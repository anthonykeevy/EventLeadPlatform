# Cursor Rules for EventLead Platform

## PowerShell Commands
- NEVER use `&&` in PowerShell commands - it's not valid syntax
- Use `;` for command chaining in PowerShell instead of `&&`
- Always test PowerShell scripts before providing them to users
- Use proper PowerShell syntax for all commands

## Testing Requirements
- ALWAYS test any scripts, configurations, or code before providing them
- Verify commands work in the target environment (PowerShell on Windows)
- Test file paths and directory structures before referencing them
- Validate that all dependencies and prerequisites are met

## Code Quality
- Ensure all provided code is syntactically correct for the target environment
- Test scripts in the actual project directory structure
- Verify file permissions and access rights
- Check that all referenced files and directories exist

## PowerShell Best Practices
- Use `Get-ChildItem` instead of `ls` for consistency
- Use `Test-Path` for file/directory existence checks
- Use proper PowerShell parameter syntax
- Avoid mixing Unix and PowerShell command syntax

## Service Management
- When asked to start services, use the automated scripts in the scripts/ directory
- Use `.\scripts\start-services-clean.ps1` to start all services
- Use `.\scripts\simple-monitor.ps1` to check service status
- Use `.\scripts\view-logs.ps1` to view service logs
- Reference `docs/SERVICE-MANAGEMENT-GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions
- Always test PowerShell scripts before providing them to users
