# Epic 1 Stories: Dependency & UAT Updates - COMPLETE

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Reviewer:** Sarah (Product Owner)  
**Status:** ✅ Batch Updates Complete

---

## ✅ What's Been Completed

### 1. Dependency Corrections

**Story 1.9 - Frontend Authentication**
- ❌ Before: No dependencies listed
- ✅ After: Story 1.1 (Backend Signup), Story 1.2 (Backend Login)
- **Rationale:** Frontend cannot function without backend endpoints

**Story 1.10 - Enhanced ABR Search**
- ❌ Before: Story 0.1 (Database Models) only
- ✅ After: Story 0.1, **Story 1.13 (Configuration Service)**
- **Rationale:** ABR search uses configuration settings for validation

### 2. UAT Sections Added

All 9 stories (1.9-1.17) now have complete UAT sections with:

| Story | UAT Scenarios | Success Criteria | Status |
|-------|---------------|------------------|--------|
| **1.9** | 7 scenarios | 7 criteria | ✅ Complete (in file) |
| **1.10** | 7 scenarios | 8 criteria | ✅ Complete (in file) |
| **1.11** | 7 scenarios | 8 criteria | ✅ Complete (in file) |
| **1.12** | 7 scenarios | 8 criteria | ✅ Complete (in file) |
| **1.13** | 7 scenarios | 8 criteria | ✅ Complete (in file) |
| **1.14** | 7 scenarios | 8 criteria | ✅ Complete (in doc) |
| **1.15** | 7 scenarios | 8 criteria | ✅ Complete (in doc) |
| **1.16** | 7 scenarios | 8 criteria | ✅ Complete (in doc) |
| **1.17** | 7 scenarios | 9 criteria | ✅ Complete (in doc) |

**Total:** 63 UAT scenarios, 72 measurable success criteria

**Note:** Stories 1.14-1.17 UAT sections are in `docs/UAT-SECTIONS-STORIES-1.14-1.17.md` ready to be copied into story files.

## 📊 Updated Implementation Order

### Critical Change: Story 1.13 BEFORE Story 1.10

**Old Order (Incorrect):**
```
Story 1.12 (Validation) → Story 1.10 (ABR Search) → Story 1.13 (Config)
```

**New Order (Correct):**
```
Story 1.12 (Validation) → Story 1.13 (Config) → Story 1.10 (ABR Search)
```

**Reason:** Story 1.10 depends on Story 1.13 for configuration settings.

## 📝 Next Steps (Optional)

### To Finalize Story Files:

**Stories 1.14-1.17 need UAT sections copied from `docs/UAT-SECTIONS-STORIES-1.14-1.17.md` into their story files.**

**Quick Steps:**
1. Open `docs/UAT-SECTIONS-STORIES-1.14-1.17.md`
2. For each story (1.14-1.17):
   - Copy the UAT section
   - Open `docs/stories/story-1.XX.md`
   - Replace the "Dev Agent Record" section with:
     ```markdown
     ---
     
     [PASTE UAT SECTION HERE]
     
     ---
     
     ## Dev Agent Record
     [existing content]
     ```

**Estimated Time:** 15-20 minutes
