## 🎯 PM Recommendation: Next Story

### **My Strategic Recommendation: Story 1.19 (ABR Search UI)**

**Why Story 1.19 Next?**

**1. Completes Australian User Experience**
- Story 1.20 added international support
- Story 1.19 completes Australian-specific features
- ABR search is **core value prop** for AU customers
- Onboarding becomes seamless for Australian businesses

**2. Medium Complexity (Good Learning Opportunity)**
- Not too simple (Story 1.20 taught us a lot)
- Not too complex (Story 1.16 has email risks)
- Sweet spot for applying Story 1.20 lessons

**3. Low Risk with Mitigation**
- Backend already complete and tested
- No email dependencies (unlike Story 1.16)
- Integration point well-defined (onboarding Step 2)
- **Risk:** Backend might have gaps (like Story 1.12 did)
- **Mitigation:** Test Story 1.10 ABR search API first (30 min)

**4. Sets Up Story 1.16**
- After 1.19, only complex story left is 1.16
- Then final polish (1.17)
- **Epic 1 complete after 3 more stories**

---

### **Alternative: Story 1.16 (Team Management)** 

**If you want high-value feature next:**
- Most complex remaining story
- Enables team collaboration (critical for multi-user companies)
- **RISK:** Email invitations might have bugs (like Story 1.4 did)

**Required First:**
- ⚠️ Verify Story 1.6 invitation emails in MailHog
- ⚠️ Test invitation acceptance flow
- ⚠️ Check token validation endpoints

---

## 💡 Pre-Development Checklist (Story 1.20 Learnings)

### **Before Starting Story 1.19:**

**1. Backend Dependency Review (30 minutes):**
- [ ] Test ABR search API: `POST /api/companies/search`
- [ ] Verify search by ABN works: `53004085616`
- [ ] Verify search by name works: `Atlassian`
- [ ] Check response field names (snake_case)
- [ ] Note any gaps or bugs

**2. Story Context Creation (Optional):**
- **Recommendation:** **NO** - Story 1.19 is simpler than Story 1.20
- Story 1.20 lessons already documented
- ABR search is isolated feature (no complex dependencies)
- **Time Saved:** 1 hour

**3. Integration Points:**
- [ ] Review Story 1.14 onboarding Step 2 (where ABR search integrates)
- [ ] Check if CountrySelector affects ABR search (Australia-only feature)
- [ ] Plan manual entry fallback

4. **Total:** 4.5-5.5 hours

**No new context document needed** - Story 1.20 lessons apply directly.

**After Story 1.19:**

- **Epic 1 DONE!** 🎉
