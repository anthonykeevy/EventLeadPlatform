**Prepared by:** Sarah (Product Owner) with Sally (UX Expert)  
**For:** Anthony Keevy  
**Status:** Ready for Review & Approval

## 🎯 Your Request

> "Evaluate what backend components are required for the User Journey process and build them first, then build a UI that utilises what was built in the backend to achieve our User Journey requirements."

**Translation:** Organize Epic 1 implementation around actual user journeys, not technical convenience. Backend first, frontend second, validate complete journeys before moving on.

---

## ✅ What We've Done

1. **Identified 5 Core User Journeys** for Epic 1:
   - Journey 1: New User Onboarding (First Company Creator)
   - Journey 2: Invited User Onboarding (Team Member)
   - Journey 3: Password Reset (Forgotten Password)
   - Journey 4: Multi-Company User (Branch/Freelancer)
   - Journey 5: Returning User (Login)

2. **Mapped All 17 Stories to Journey Components:**
   - Each story enables specific journey steps
   - No orphan stories (all serve user needs)
   - Clear dependencies between backend and frontend

3. **Created Journey-Centric Implementation Plan:**
   - Backend built first (stable API foundation)
   - Frontend consumes backend APIs (no mocking)
   - Each wave delivers complete testable journey
   - UAT validates real user experience

4. **Validated with UX Expert (Sally):**
   - Confirmed journey completeness
   - Identified UX risks and mitigations
   - Defined success metrics per journey
   - Approved implementation approach

## 🎯 Why This Approach Wins

### **Backend-First Strategy:**

✅ **Stable Foundation:** Frontend has complete, tested APIs to consume  
✅ **No Mocking:** Frontend developers see real data and responses  
✅ **Independent Testing:** Backend validated via Postman before frontend work  
✅ **Reduced Rework:** API contracts stable before frontend implementation  
✅ **Faster Integration:** Backend already validated when frontend integrates

### **Journey-Centric Strategy:**

✅ **User Value:** Each wave delivers complete user journey (not isolated features)  
✅ **Testable:** UAT validates real end-to-end user experience  
✅ **Demonstrable:** Product Owner can demo complete flows to stakeholders  
✅ **Risk Management:** Core journeys first, advanced features later  
✅ **Prioritization:** Clear why each story matters (serves specific journey step)

### **UX Expert Validation (Sally):**

> "This approach ensures every sprint delivers user-facing value, not just technical checkboxes. By organizing around user journeys, we validate each flow end-to-end before moving to the next, reducing risk and improving quality. The backend-first pattern is particularly smart - it means frontend developers have stable APIs to work with, reducing frustration and rework."
