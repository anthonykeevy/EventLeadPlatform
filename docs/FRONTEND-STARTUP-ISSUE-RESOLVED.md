# Frontend Startup Issue - RESOLVED ✅

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Issue:** Frontend failing to start due to missing auth components  
**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**  

---

## 🔍 Problem

The frontend (Vite dev server) was failing to start with the error:

```
Failed to resolve import "./features/auth" from "src\App.tsx". Does the file exist?
```

### Root Cause

`App.tsx` (line 3) was importing auth components:
```typescript
import { SignupForm, EmailVerification, LoginForm } from './features/auth'
```

But the `frontend/src/features/auth/` directory existed but was **empty** (only contained `__tests__/`), with no `index.tsx` export file.

---

## ✅ Solution

Created a placeholder/stub file: `frontend/src/features/auth/index.tsx`

```typescript
import React from 'react'

// Placeholder components until auth features are fully implemented
export const SignupForm = () => {
  return <div>Signup Form (To be implemented)</div>
}

export const EmailVerification = () => {
  return <div>Email Verification (To be implemented)</div>
}

export const LoginForm = () => {
  return <div>Login Form (To be implemented)</div>
}
```

**Note:** These are temporary stubs. The actual auth components will be implemented in their respective Epic 1 stories (Stories 1.1-1.4).

## 🚀 How to Start Frontend Now

```powershell
# From project root
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
VITE v5.0.0  ready in XXX ms

➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

## 📝 Git Commit

**Commit:** `b414de5`  
**Message:** "Fix: Add placeholder auth components for frontend startup"

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. ✅ Backend is running (port 8000)
2. ✅ Frontend fix applied
3. 📋 **TODO:** Start frontend: `cd frontend; npm run dev`
4. 📋 **TODO:** Proceed with Story 1.13 UAT (see `docs/UAT-INSTRUCTIONS-STORY-1.13.md`)

---

## 📚 Background

**Why this happened:**
- Story 1.13 focused on backend Configuration Service
- Frontend only created `features/config/` for Story 1.13
- Auth features (`features/auth/`) are from earlier stories (1.1-1.4) that haven't been fully implemented yet
- `App.tsx` was referencing these future auth components

**Resolution:**
- Created stub components so frontend can build and run
- Auth components will be properly implemented in their own stories

---

## ✅ Status

**Frontend:** ✅ Ready to start (build error fixed)  
**Backend:** ✅ Running on port 8000  
**Story 1.13:** ✅ Ready for UAT  

**Ready for:** User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for Story 1.13
