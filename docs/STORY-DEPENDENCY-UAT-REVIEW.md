## üìù Recommended Updates

### 1. **Update Story 1.9 Dependencies**

**Current:** None  
**Recommended:** Story 1.1 (Signup Backend), Story 1.2 (Login Backend)

**Rationale:** Frontend auth pages cannot function without backend endpoints.

---

### 2. **Update Story 1.10 Dependencies (Optional)**

**Current:** Story 0.1  
**Recommended:** Story 0.1, Story 1.13 (Configuration Service)

**Rationale:** ABR search may use configuration service for validation settings, but can work without it using code defaults.

---

### 3. **Update Story 1.16 Dependencies (Optional)**

**Current:** Story 1.6, 1.7, 1.9  
**Recommended:** Story 1.6, 1.7, 1.9, Story 1.11 (Company Switching)

**Rationale:** Team management dashboard shows company context, which is enhanced by multi-company support. However, basic team management works without 1.11.

---

### 4. **Add UAT Section to All Stories**

Each story should include:

```markdown
## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

### UAT Scenarios

[List of 5-7 key user scenarios to test]

### UAT Success Criteria

[Measurable criteria for UAT pass/fail]
- [ ] Criterion 1 (with metric)
- [ ] Criterion 2 (with metric)
- [ ] Criterion 3 (with metric)

### UAT Test Plan

**Participants:** 5-10 representative users (mix of technical/non-technical)  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours per participant  
**Environment:** Staging environment with realistic data  
**Facilitation:** Product Owner observes, takes notes, does not intervene

**Process:**
1. Provide scenario context (no step-by-step instructions)
2. Ask user to complete task using their own approach
3. Observe where users struggle or succeed
4. Collect feedback on clarity, ease of use, and satisfaction
5. Document completion rates, time to complete, and issues encountered

**Success Threshold:** ‚â•80% of UAT scenarios pass with ‚â•80% of testers
```
