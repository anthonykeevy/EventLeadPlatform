# Brainstorming Session Results

**Session Date:** 2025-10-10
**Facilitator:** Business Analyst Mary
**Participant:** Anthony Keevy

## Executive Summary

**Topic:** Business model and go-to-market strategy for Event Lead Collection Platform

**Session Goals:** Validate and refine the three concurrent business models (Direct Day-Pass, Consumption-based with Base Pack + SKUs, Reseller/Wholesale). Explore go-to-market strategies and customer acquisition approaches. Identify potential gaps, conflicts, or areas of confusion in the current business model design. Examine pricing strategy, customer segmentation, value proposition, and whether the multiple models work synergistically or create market confusion.

**Techniques Used:** 
1. Question Storming (15 min) - Surfaced 8 major strategic questions
2. Six Thinking Hats (20 min) - Systematic evaluation from facts, emotions, benefits, risks, alternatives, and process perspectives
3. Assumption Reversal (15 min) - Challenged 5 core assumptions about building and selling
4. SCAMPER (20 min) - Refined business model through Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, and Reverse lenses

**Total Ideas Generated:** 100+ across all techniques

### Key Themes Identified:

**Business Model Transformation:**
- Evolved from complex 3-tier pricing (Day-Pass/Consumption/Reseller) to simple "Create Free, Pay to Publish" per-event model
- Discovered potential for 5+ business models but chose to focus on ONE for MVP: Direct to individual businesses

**Unique Differentiator:**
- Prize Draw with gamification emerged as THE key feature to compete against Google Forms
- Solves exhibitors' real problem: booth traffic, not just lead collection
- Justifies premium pricing and creates viral moments

**Solo Founder Reality:**
- 3-month revenue deadline with complex technical build
- Bootstrap constraints require focus and discipline
- Platform foundation = 1 month, must resist feature creep

## Technique Sessions

### Technique 1: Question Storming (15 min)

**Purpose:** Surface all critical questions about business models, pricing, market strategy, and platform economics before seeking answers.

**Questions Generated:**

1. **What business model is best to launch with and will allow growth into other models?**

2. **What is the cost point to provide this service that will have mass adoption?** (Free is not an option)
   - What do event organizers currently pay for lead collection alternatives?
   - What's the "impulse buy" threshold vs "need approval"?
   - What's the breakeven point per customer?
   - How much is a qualified lead worth to different customer types?

3. **Would it be better to start in one market like Australia or make available globally?**
   - Can we dominate locally before going global?
   - Regulatory/compliance differences across regions?
   - Timezone/support complexity?
   - CAC differences between focused vs scattered marketing?

4. **What are the best marketing strategies to get customer awareness?**
   - Where do event organizers hang out?
   - Direct to organizers or through venues/suppliers?
   - Leverage Partner-of-Record/Reseller network?
   - Virality potential?
   - Product-led growth vs sales team?

5. **Strategic Market Expansion:** Starting with individual businesses at events, then offering Event Packages to event organizers who provide platform free to ALL exhibitors
   - Conflict or complementary channels?
   - If exhibitor already pays, then event provides free - refund? Credit?
   - White label opportunity?
   - B2B vs B2B2B pricing model?

6. **How do we handle custom/bespoke components as additional revenue stream?**
   - Professional services vs marketplace?
   - Services trap distraction from core product?
   - Custom components exclusive or added to platform?
   - Time & materials vs fixed bid pricing?
   - Plugin architecture from day one?

7. **Marketplace Model:** Allow creative marketers/designers to sell form design services through our platform
   - Commission rate? (10%? 20%? 30%?)
   - Quality control and vetting?
   - Chicken-and-egg: attract designers before customers?
   - Template marketplace vs bespoke services?
   - Conflict with internal custom services?

8. **White Label/Reseller Model:** Creatives use platform invisibly for their customers, we charge creatives for platform use
   - How to charge: per form? per submission? monthly license? revenue share?
   - End customers never know we exist - good or bad?
   - Creatives keep 100% vs marketplace commission - which attracts better talent?
   - Quality control when we don't control customer relationship?
   - Can one platform support both marketplace AND white label?

**KEY INSIGHT DISCOVERED:** The business is evolving from simple "3 pricing models" (Day-Pass/Consumption/Reseller from PRD) into a **multi-sided platform** with potentially FIVE distinct business models:
- Direct to Individual Businesses
- Event Packages to Event Organizers  
- Custom/Bespoke Component Services
- Designer Marketplace
- White Label/Reseller Program

**CRITICAL QUESTIONS:**
- Can all five models coexist or do some conflict?
- Which should we launch with?
- What's the sequencing strategy?
- Which creates the most defensible moat?

### Technique 2: Six Thinking Hats (20 min)

**Purpose:** Systematically evaluate business model options from six distinct perspectives to make better decisions without conflict.

#### WHITE HAT - Facts & Information

**Constraints:**
- Solo founder/developer using Cursor + BMAD (few months experience with agentic tools)
- Full-time availability: 8 hours/day
- **Total runway: 6 months**
- **CRITICAL: Need revenue within 3 months**
- Breakeven target: $14,000/month
- No existing customers, no market research yet

**Market Experience:**
- Previously paid ~$200/form for manual contractor development
- Long process: requirements → approval → dev (2-3 days) → testing
- 6-10 events/year per company = $1,200-$2,000 annual spend
- Competitor built complex form builder that FAILED (too complex, marketing team gave up)
- Companies preferred per-event pricing but had developer retainer

**Target Market:**
- Sydney events: ~10 events/weekend = 40 events/month
- If 2-3 exhibitors per event adopt = achievable scale

#### RED HAT - Emotions & Intuition

- $100/month subscription feels "just right" 
- Believes 140 monthly customers more achievable than 14-23 annual
- Optimistic and confident: "I can do anything"
- Recognizes Google/Microsoft Forms as competition
- Torn between market expansion (any forms) vs niche focus (event forms)
- **Biggest concern:** Technical complexity of form builder (custom backgrounds, freeform placement)
- **Reality check:** "Finding customers is the hardest job" (past business experience)
- Having the most fun in a long time with agentic development

#### YELLOW HAT - Benefits & Optimism

**Key Differentiator Identified:**
- Custom background images + freeform component placement + aspect ratio maintenance
- Creates unique branded forms that don't look like generic builders
- Multiple exhibitors at same event can't tell others are using same platform
- Appeals to creatives and marketers wanting brand consistency

**Growth Strategy:**
- Price point as "no brainer" → word-of-mouth marketing
- Platform could lead to related product opportunities
- Viral potential if forms look professional
- Sydney events GTM: Specific, local, targetable market

#### BLACK HAT - Risks & Caution

**Technical Risk:**
- Complex form builder may take longer than 3 months
- Using new tools (Cursor + BMAD) with limited experience
- Mitigation: Build foundation → evaluate feasibility → pivot if needed

**Customer Acquisition Risk:**
- 140+ customers in 3 months = ~12 new customers/week
- Word-of-mouth takes time, need immediate sales momentum
- Monthly subscription for one-event use = HIGH CHURN RISK
- Need 140 NEW customers EVERY month to maintain revenue

**Market/Product Fit Risk:**
- Custom backgrounds valuable to creatives, but overkill for "quick event form"?
- Building for designers or busy event coordinators?
- Can't reach exhibitors with zero marketing budget?

#### GREEN HAT - Creative Alternatives

**BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATION:**

**Form + Giveaway Draw Platform**

Instead of just form collection, solve TWO problems:
1. Lead collection with branded forms
2. Booth traffic generation via giveaway draws

**Premium Feature:** 
- Giveaway draw management
- Automated SMS 30 mins before draw: "Come to Booth X at 3PM for the draw - you could win [prize]!"
- Winner announcement/notification
- Drives attendees BACK to booth for second touchpoint

**Why This Works:**
- Solves exhibitor's real problem: Getting people to their booth
- SMS reminder creates urgency and engagement
- More leads because people sign up for giveaway
- Clear upsell path (Standard → Premium)
- SMS costs predictable per event
- **Unique differentiator** - Google Forms doesn't do this!

**Pricing Models Considered:**
- Monthly subscription ($100/month) - HIGH CHURN RISK ❌
- Event Pass ($75/event) - too many customers needed ❌
- Hybrid models - too complex for MVP ❌
- Credit packs - hard to sell upfront ❌
- Freemium - need revenue NOW ❌
- Annual unlimited - fewer customers but harder sale ⚠️

#### BLUE HAT - Process & Decision Making

**DECISION MADE: Flat-fee per event with two tiers**

**Final Pricing:**
- **Standard: $99/event** - Form + hosting + lead collection + basic draw management
- **Premium: $199/event** - Everything + giveaway draw + SMS reminders (up to 100 people)

**Economics:**
- Breakeven: $14,000/month
- At Premium ($199): 70 events/month = ~17 events/week ✅
- At 50/50 mix ($149 avg): 94 events/month = ~23 events/week ✅
- At all Standard ($99): 142 events/month = 35 events/week ⚠️

**Why This Works:**
- Still cheaper than $200/form contractor baseline
- Positions as premium service, not commodity
- Fewer customers needed = realistic for solo founder
- Aligns with customer need (per-event, not subscription)
- No churn complexity (one-time purchase)
- Clear value proposition and upsell path
- Premium tier profitable even with SMS costs

**Sydney Events GTM Strategy:**
- 40+ events/month in Sydney
- Need 2-4 customers per event to hit targets
- Local, targetable, specific market

### Technique 3: Assumption Reversal (15 min)

**Purpose:** Challenge core assumptions to reveal blind spots or better approaches.

**Key Assumptions Challenged:**

1. **"Need complex form builder with custom backgrounds"**
   - REVERSED: What if customers just want templates?
   - RESPONSE: Form builder IS the core - leads are most important success metric. Additional services (like draws) build on lead collection foundation.

2. **"Customers will find me through word-of-mouth"**
   - REVERSED: What if you need customers BEFORE building?
   - RESPONSE: Can't pre-sell due to technical uncertainty. Would be devastating to refund if unable to deliver. Need to validate technical feasibility first.

3. **"Exhibitors will pay $99-199 per event"**
   - REVERSED: What if they won't pay that?
   - RESPONSE: Acknowledged need for market research to validate value proposition before building.

4. **"Should start bottom-up (individual exhibitors)"**
   - REVERSED: What if top-down (event organizers) is easier?
   - RESPONSE: Top-down requires MORE effort (dashboard, reporting, multi-exhibitor management). Bottom-up simpler for MVP.

5. **"This is a form builder business"**
   - REVERSED: What if it's an event marketing business?
   - RESPONSE: Form builder is the foundation that enables evolution into marketing business. Must nail core first.

**Key Insight:** Anthony is being appropriately cautious about technical risk and scope. Recognizes forms as foundation that enables future marketing services.

### Technique 4: SCAMPER Method (20 min)

**Purpose:** Systematically refine the business model through seven creative lenses.

#### S - SUBSTITUTE

**Evaluated:**
- Templates instead of complex builder → MAYBE (easier technically, option for some customers)
- Partner channels → NO (need direct feedback for product development)
- WhatsApp/Email instead of SMS → NO (SMS universal, all mobiles have it)
- Hire contractors → NO (learning goal: build agentic programming skills)
- Bootstrap approach → YES (no costs until revenue flows)

#### C - COMBINE

**Decisions:**
- ✅ **Custom backgrounds + template library** (Best of both worlds!)
- ✅ **CSV export** in standard formats (Salesforce, Marketing Cloud, Emarsys)
- ✅ **Analytics dashboard** (minimalistic for MVP, already in scope)
- 🔮 **CRM integration** (future - retention hook when ready)
- 🔮 **Follow-up email automation** (future service)
- ❌ **QR codes** (no value for this use case)

**Key Combo:** Customers can start with template OR upload background to make it unique.

#### A - ADAPT

**From other industries:**
- ✅ **Gamify the draw** (spin wheel, countdown, winner animation)
- Creates memorable booth moment
- Shareable/photogenic experience
- Differentiates from generic "pick from hat" approach

#### M - MODIFY

**Amplify:**
- Variable pricing for cost-based fields (address validation services)
- SMS usage-based billing
- Multiple prize draws per event (if charged separately)
- "Form live in 5 minutes" as key marketing message

**Minimize:**
- Feature bloat in MVP
- Form builder + analytics = essential
- Prize draw after MVP foundation is stable
- Platform foundation = 1 month minimum effort

**Development Sequence:**
1. Platform foundation (1 month)
2. Form builder (custom backgrounds, templates, analytics)
3. Prize draw + SMS feature (after foundation solid)

#### P - PUT TO OTHER USES

**Adjacent markets identified:**
- Job fairs, conferences, retail contests, career fairs, product launches, real estate open houses, community events
- All are "events" but harder to discover publicly
- Some need always-on forms → monthly billing more suitable
- **Decision:** Design platform to accommodate, but market to events FIRST
- Priority = breakeven ASAP to reduce financial stress

#### E - ELIMINATE

**Cannot eliminate from MVP:**
- ❌ Custom backgrounds (core differentiator)
- ❌ Validation rules (data quality = retention, >10% bad leads = churn)
- ❌ Drag-and-drop (personal goal + achievable complexity)

**Minimized:**
- Analytics = minimalistic for MVP
- Responsive = tablet (not phone)
- Scope focused on core value

**🎯 KEY INSIGHT: "Create FREE, Pay to PUBLISH" model**
- Customers build forms without payment
- Emotional investment in creation
- Pay only when ready to go live
- Lower barrier to try, easier to convert

#### R - REVERSE

**Major Business Model Refinement:**

**OLD MODEL:** Pay → Build → Publish  
**NEW MODEL:** Build FREE → Preview → Pay → Publish ✅

**Why This Works:**
- No barrier to entry (try before buy)
- Sunk cost fallacy works in our favor (invested time)
- Customer sees value before paying
- Pride in creation = easier conversion
- Freemium funnel without ongoing free users

**Final MVP Pricing:**
- **Standard: $99/event** - Custom form + hosting + analytics + CSV export
- **Premium: $199/event** - Everything + gamified prize draw + SMS reminders
- Create unlimited forms FREE, pay per publish

10. **Bootstrap Reality**
   - $14k/month breakeven, no marketing budget
   - Need viral/word-of-mouth built into product
   - Direct sales = customer feedback for product development
   - Can't afford distraction of multiple business models

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Build MVP Technical Foundation

**Rationale:** Platform architecture must support form builder, user accounts, payment gates, and future features. Getting this right in Month 1 prevents costly refactors later. Foundation enables "Create Free, Pay to Publish" model and all future expansion.

**Next Steps:**
1. Define core data models (User, Form, Submission, Payment, Template)
2. Set up authentication system (accounts required for "Create Free" model)
3. Build form storage and draft management (unpublished forms)
4. Set up hosting infrastructure on Azure
5. Implement payment gate before publish (Stripe integration)
6. Build form publishing engine (public URL generation)
7. Set up submission handling and storage

**Resources Needed:**
- ✅ Azure hosting (already setup)
- ✅ MS SQL Server database (already configured)
- Backend framework (Python/FastAPI based on PRD architecture)
- Cursor + BMAD agentic development tools
- Stripe API for payment processing
- Azure CDN for form hosting

**Timeline:** Month 1 (4 weeks full-time) - Weeks 1-4

**Success Criteria:**
- Can create user account
- Can create and save draft form
- Payment flow works end-to-end
- Can publish form and generate public URL
- Forms accept and store submissions

---

#### #2 Priority: Define MVP Scope Document (Update PRD)

**Rationale:** Current PRD has outdated business model (Day-Pass/Consumption/Reseller pricing from ADRs). Need updated specification reflecting "Create Free, Pay to Publish" model, new pricing strategy, and prize draw roadmap to guide development.

**Next Steps:**
1. Update PRD business model section:
   - Remove Day-Pass, Consumption, Reseller models
   - Document "Create Free, Pay to Publish" approach
   - New pricing: $99 Standard / $199 Premium per event
2. Document revised user flows (signup → build → preview → pay → publish)
3. Specify MVP technical scope (8 core features from brainstorming)
4. Document Phase 2 roadmap (Prize draw + SMS, CRM integration, Address validation)
5. Add long-term vision section (Event marketing platform, Designer marketplace moonshots)
6. Update success metrics to reflect new business model
7. Archive old ADRs or mark as superseded

**Resources Needed:**
- This brainstorming session document as primary reference
- Current PRD at docs/prd.md
- Time for clear specification writing
- Possibly create new ADR for business model pivot

**Timeline:** This week (2-3 days) - Complete before starting foundation build

**Success Criteria:**
- PRD accurately reflects new business model
- Development team (you) has clear scope
- Can reference PRD for all MVP decisions
- Phase 2 roadmap documented for later

---

#### #3 Priority: Build Phase 1 - Form Builder (Forms Only, No Prize Draw Yet)

**Rationale:** Focus on core value proposition (lead collection with custom branding) first. Validate technical feasibility of drag-and-drop + custom backgrounds. Prove the foundation works before adding prize draw complexity. This approach reduces risk and gets to revenue faster.

**Next Steps:**
1. **Form Builder Interface:**
   - Drag-and-drop canvas for component placement
   - Component library (name, email, phone, text, dropdown, checkbox, radio)
   - Freeform positioning on canvas
   - Aspect ratio maintenance on publish

2. **Custom Backgrounds + Templates:**
   - Image upload and storage (Azure Blob Storage?)
   - Pre-built template library (5-10 professional templates)
   - Template selection OR custom background upload
   - Background image optimization

3. **Form Rendering Engine:**
   - Tablet-responsive published forms
   - Touch-friendly form inputs
   - Real-time preview in builder
   - Public form hosting

4. **Analytics Dashboard (Minimalistic):**
   - Real-time lead count
   - Basic demographics (if collected)
   - Submission timeline
   - CSV export (Salesforce, Marketing Cloud, Emarsys formats)

5. **Data Validation:**
   - Field-level validation rules
   - Email format validation
   - Phone number validation
   - Required field enforcement
   - Error messaging and user feedback

6. **Payment Integration:**
   - Stripe payment flow
   - $99 Standard tier only for MVP
   - Invoice generation
   - Receipt emails
   - Payment status tracking

**Resources Needed:**
- Frontend framework (React based on modern stack?)
- Drag-and-drop library evaluation (react-dnd? dnd-kit?)
- Azure Blob Storage for image hosting
- Form rendering engine (custom or library?)
- Analytics charting library (Chart.js? Recharts?)
- Stripe SDK and API
- Email service (SendGrid? Azure Communication Services?)

**Timeline:** Month 2-3 (8 weeks after foundation) - Weeks 5-12

**Success Criteria:**
- Customer can build custom-branded form in <5 minutes
- Form publishes and accepts submissions reliably
- Data validation prevents bad leads (>90% quality)
- Analytics dashboard shows real-time data
- Payment flow works end-to-end
- CSV export works with standard CRM formats
- Ready to start acquiring customers

**TOTAL TIMELINE: 3 months to revenue-generating MVP** ✅

**Post-MVP (Month 4+):** Add Prize Draw + SMS feature to unlock Premium tier ($199)

## Reflection and Follow-up

### What Worked Well

**Technique Effectiveness:**
- **Question Storming** surfaced critical uncertainty about business model complexity and revealed the multi-sided platform hidden in original PRD
- **Six Thinking Hats** systematic analysis prevented emotional decision-making and forced realistic assessment of solo founder constraints
- **Assumption Reversal** challenged build-first approach and revealed need for market research (though Anthony chose to proceed with technical validation first)
- **SCAMPER** produced the session's biggest breakthrough: "Create Free, Pay to Publish" model and Prize Draw differentiator

**Session Dynamics:**
- Direct, honest facilitation helped Anthony face reality of 3-month timeline vs ambition
- Anthony's willingness to evolve thinking during session (from monthly subscription to per-event to freemium builder)
- Focus on technical decisions over marketing fluff aligned with Anthony's developer mindset
- Progressive technique flow worked perfectly: Question → Analyze → Challenge → Refine

### Areas for Further Exploration

**Market Validation (Critical Gap):**
- Need to talk to 10-20 exhibitors about pricing and prize draw value proposition
- Understand what exhibitors currently pay for lead collection
- Validate Sydney events market accessibility
- Research competitors' actual feature sets and pricing

**Technical Feasibility:**
- Proof-of-concept for drag-and-drop + custom backgrounds (de-risk early)
- Evaluate drag-and-drop libraries before committing
- Test form rendering across tablet devices
- Validate Azure infrastructure can scale

**Go-to-Market Strategy:**
- How to discover Sydney events systematically? (Eventbrite? Venue websites?)
- How to reach exhibitors 2-4 weeks before events?
- What marketing assets needed? (Landing page, demo video, case studies?)
- Partner opportunities with event venues or organizers?

**Financial Modeling:**
- Break down $14k/month by customer acquisition funnel
- Calculate realistic conversion rates for "Create Free, Pay to Publish"
- Model CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) with zero marketing budget
- Runway extension scenarios if revenue takes longer

### Recommended Follow-up Techniques

**For Market Validation Session:**
- **Customer Interviews** (CIS technique) - Structured interviews with 10 target exhibitors
- **Value Proposition Canvas** (BMM technique) - Map customer pains/gains to product features
- **Competitor Analysis Matrix** (BMM technique) - Systematic comparison of alternatives

**For Technical Planning Session:**
- **Story Mapping** (BMM technique) - Break down MVP into user stories and sprints

- **Messaging Framework** - Craft positioning and key messages
- **Launch Plan** - Sequence of activities for first 90 days

### Questions That Emerged

**Still Unanswered:**
1. Can Anthony realistically build all 8 MVP features in 3 months solo?
2. Will $99/$199 pricing be compelling enough vs free alternatives?
3. How to reach exhibitors before events without marketing budget?
4. Should prize draw be in MVP or can Anthony get to revenue without it?
5. What if technical complexity is underestimated? Backup plan?
6. How to handle first customer support requests as solo founder while building?
7. Is Sydney market large enough or should Australia-wide launch be considered?

**For Customer Discovery:**
1. What do exhibitors currently use for lead collection at events?
2. What's their biggest frustration with current solutions?
3. Would they pay $99/$199 for custom-branded forms?
4. Is prize draw feature valuable enough to pay extra?
5. Do they need forms to be live immediately or can they wait for event date?
