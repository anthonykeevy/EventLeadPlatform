- **Target Customer:** B2B exhibitors attending 1-10 events/year who value custom branding and cost savings

- No special hardware required (BYOD - bring your own device)

**Strengths:**
- **Most affordable event-specific platform** ($100-$300 per event, competitive with Event Lead Platform)
- Unlimited users (no per-seat fees)
- No contract required (true pay-per-event model)
- Simple setup (BYOD, no hardware rentals)
- CSV export included
- Good for budget-conscious exhibitors

**Weaknesses:**
- Basic feature set (no gamification, limited CRM integrations)
- Generic forms (no custom backgrounds mentioned)
- Less polished UI compared to premium platforms
- Limited analytics (basic reporting only)
- Not as feature-rich as Momencio/Captello/Cvent

**Competitive Comparison to Event Lead Platform:**
- **Price:** Eventleaf at $100-$300 per event is **comparable** to Event Lead Platform at $99. Event Lead Platform is **0-67% cheaper** depending on Eventleaf tier.
- **Differentiation:** Eventleaf focuses on affordability and badge scanning; Event Lead Platform focuses on custom backgrounds and beautiful form builder.
- **Target Customer Overlap:** High - Both target budget-conscious event exhibitors. **Most direct price competitor.**
- **Competitive Advantage for Event Lead Platform:** Custom backgrounds (Eventleaf doesn't mention this), drag-and-drop form builder, more polished UI, event-based organization with multi-form support.
- **Competitive Advantage for Eventleaf:** Unlimited users (Event Lead Platform is company-based, so also unlimited users for company team), badge scanning (if event has badges).
- **When Customer Chooses Eventleaf:** When they need badge scanning capability and are okay with generic forms, or when they're at the $100 price tier.
- **When Customer Chooses Event Lead Platform:** When they prioritize custom branding, beautiful forms with drag-and-drop builder, polished UX, and are willing to pay $99 for premium appearance.

**Strategic Note:** Eventleaf is your closest price competitor. You must differentiate on **custom backgrounds, form builder quality, and professional appearance**. Your forms should look **significantly better** than Eventleaf's generic forms to justify $99 vs. Eventleaf's $100-$300 range.

### 14. Swapcard (Event App Platform with Lead Capture)

**Category:** Event App & Networking Platform (Lead Capture Module)

**Business Model:**
- Annual subscription with tiered plans based on attendee count
- Designed for event organizers (not individual exhibitors), but exhibitors can access lead capture as part of event app
- Focus on event networking, matchmaking, and engagement

**Pricing:**
- **Starter Plan:** **$520 USD/year** (up to 1,000 attendees; includes lead capture, app access)
  - Cost increases with additional staff or exhibitor spots
  - For one-off events, may pro-rate or offer trial license (inquire)
- **Professional/Enterprise:** **$4,500+/year** (larger/multi-event use)

**Features:**
- Event app with attendee networking
- Lead capture for exhibitors
- AI-powered matchmaking
- In-app messaging
- Session scheduling
- Analytics and reporting
- Sponsor/exhibitor promotion
- Lead retrieval (part of exhibitor package)
- Badge scanning (if event has badges)

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive event app platform (beyond lead capture)
- AI-powered networking and matchmaking
- Good for event organizers who want to offer lead capture to exhibitors as part of event package
- Scalable for multiple events
- Strong networking features increase attendee engagement

**Weaknesses:**
- **Expensive annual subscription** ($520-$4,500/year)
- Designed for event organizers, not individual exhibitors (exhibitors access as part of event package)
- Annual commitment required (not true per-event pricing)
- Overkill for individual exhibitors just needing lead capture (full event app platform is more than they need)
- No mention of custom backgrounds for exhibitor forms

**Competitive Comparison to Event Lead Platform:**
- **Price:** Swapcard Starter at $520/year vs. Event Lead Platform at $594/year (6 events). **Swapcard is 12% cheaper annually IF exhibitor attends 6+ events.** However, Swapcard requires annual commitment; Event Lead Platform is pay-per-event.
- **Differentiation:** Swapcard is an event app platform (for organizers); Event Lead Platform is a lead capture tool (for exhibitors). Different target customers.
- **Target Customer Overlap:** Low-Medium - Swapcard targets event organizers; Event Lead Platform targets exhibitors. However, if event organizer bundles Swapcard, exhibitors may use included lead capture instead of purchasing Event Lead Platform.
- **Competitive Threat:** Medium - If event organizers adopt Swapcard and bundle lead capture for exhibitors, this reduces market for Event Lead Platform. However, Swapcard is expensive for organizers, so adoption may be limited to large events.
- **Competitive Advantage for Event Lead Platform:** Targets individual exhibitors (no dependence on event organizer), custom backgrounds, simpler setup, per-event pricing (no annual commitment).
- **When Customer Chooses Swapcard:** When event organizer bundles Swapcard app with exhibitor package, or when exhibitor attends 10+ events/year and wants comprehensive networking features.
- **When Customer Chooses Event Lead Platform:** When exhibitor needs standalone lead capture tool (not dependent on event organizer), prioritizes custom branding, attends 1-6 events/year.

## Business Model Comparison

### Common Pricing Models Observed

| **Model** | **Description** | **Examples** | **Typical Pricing Range** | **Customer Pays For** |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| **Subscription (Form-Based)** | Monthly/annual fee based on form count and submission volume | Jotform, LeadGen App | $19 - $99/month | Access to platform, feature set, form/submission limits |
| **Subscription (All-Inclusive)** | Single plan with unlimited forms, fixed lead volume cap | LeadCapture.io | $299/month | All features, up to 10,000 leads/month |
| **Freemium + Paid Tiers** | Free plan with limited features, paid plans unlock advanced features | HubSpot Forms, Jotform | Free - $3,600/month | Advanced features, higher limits, automation |
| **Hybrid (Subscription + Overage)** | Base subscription with lead volume cap, pay-per-lead overage fees | GetLeadForms | $47 - $297/month + $0.12 - $0.19 per extra lead | Base subscription + overage leads |
| **Pay-Per-Lead** | Payment per individual lead (no subscription) | GlobalDataUSA, MedicalBilling.com | $0.27 - $480 per lead | Individual leads (exclusive or shared) |
| **Event-Based (Per-Event Fee)** | Per-event pricing (one-time fee per event, no recurring) | **Event Lead Platform**, Eventleaf, Momencio, Cvent | **$99 - $800 per event** | Per-event access, lead capture, form hosting, exhibitor tools |
| **Event Subscription (Per-User)** | Monthly subscription for event exhibitors | iCapture, Captello, Momencio | $50 - $106/user/month | Ongoing lead capture for multiple events, CRM automation |
| **Event Platform (Annual)** | Annual subscription for event organizers (exhibitor lead capture included) | Swapcard | $520 - $4,500/year | Event app platform with lead capture for exhibitors |

### **Event Lead Platform's Unique Model: "Create Free, Pay to Publish"**

**Your Model:**
- Free to create draft forms (unlimited)
- $99 one-time fee per published form per event
- No subscription, no recurring fees
- Event-based organization (forms belong to events)

**Uniqueness:**
- **Not observed in any competitor researched.** This is a novel approach in the lead capture market.
- Closest analog is "freemium," but you charge per publish (one-time), not per month (recurring).
- Aligns with event exhibitor mental model: "I'm paying for this specific event, not an ongoing subscription."

**Strategic Advantages:**
1. **Low Barrier to Entry:** Free to try, no commitment required (reduces friction).
2. **Event-Specific Pricing:** Customers pay only for events they attend (matches their budget cycle).
3. **No Subscription Fatigue:** One-time payment is simpler and less intimidating than monthly fees.
4. **Emotional Investment:** Time spent building form increases likelihood of publishing (sunk cost effect).
5. **Predictable Revenue per Event:** Easy to forecast revenue based on event attendance.

**Potential Challenges:**
1. **One-Time Payment Limits LTV:** Subscription models generate recurring revenue; your model requires repeat customers or high-volume events.
2. **Lower Revenue per Customer:** A customer attending 3 events/year generates $297 total vs. Jotform Gold at $99/month = $1,188/year.
3. **Conversion Dependency:** Revenue depends on conversion rate (draft → published). If conversion is low, revenue suffers.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Focus on Repeat Customers:** Target businesses attending multiple events per year (6-10 events annually per your PRD).
- **Upsell Premium Features:** Introduce paid add-ons (e.g., prize draw at $199 in Phase 2) to increase ARPU.
- **High Conversion Rate:** Your preview testing requirement (5 tests before publish) ensures quality and commitment, improving conversion likelihood.

## Competitive Positioning Analysis

### Where Event Lead Platform Fits in the Market

**Positioning Statement:**
*"Event Lead Platform is the only custom-branded lead collection form builder designed specifically for event exhibitors, offering freeform design with custom backgrounds and a pay-per-publish model ($99 per event). Unlike generic form builders (Jotform, HubSpot) or online lead gen platforms (LeadCapture.io), Event Lead Platform is purpose-built for in-person events with event-based organization, multi-tenant team collaboration, and Australian compliance."*

### Competitive Advantages (Differentiators)

1. **Custom Backgrounds**
   - **Unique Feature:** No competitor offers custom background images with freeform component placement.
   - **Customer Value:** Professional, branded forms that match event booth aesthetics (vs. generic templates).
   - **Competitive Gap:** Jotform, HubSpot, LeadCapture.io, GetLeadForms all use template-based forms with limited branding customization.

2. **Event-Based Organization**
   - **Unique Feature:** Forms are organized by events; companies manage multiple events with multiple forms per event.
   - **Customer Value:** Matches event exhibitor mental model (I'm attending Event X, I need forms for Event X).
   - **Competitive Gap:** Most competitors treat forms as standalone entities, not tied to events.

3. **Pay-Per-Publish Model**
   - **Unique Feature:** Create free, pay only when publishing ($99 per form per event).
   - **Customer Value:** No subscription commitment, low barrier to entry, aligns with event budget cycles.
   - **Competitive Gap:** No competitor uses this model (all are subscription-based or pay-per-lead).

4. **Multi-Tenant Team Collaboration**
   - **Unique Feature (in event space):** Company Admin and Company User roles; team members collaborate on events and forms; Admin handles publishing and billing.
   - **Customer Value:** Enables marketing, events, and sales teams to work together within a company account.
   - **Competitive Gap:** General form builders offer multi-user accounts, but not event-specific workflows with role-based access for publishing.

5. **Australian Market Focus**
   - **Unique Feature:** GST-compliant invoicing, ABN validation, Australian address validation (GeoScape API in Phase 2).
   - **Customer Value:** Builds trust with Australian businesses, ensures compliance, addresses local needs.
   - **Competitive Gap:** Most competitors are US-based; few offer Australian-specific compliance features.

6. **Preview Testing System**
   - **Unique Feature:** Requires 5 preview tests before publishing (customizable by Company Admin).
   - **Customer Value:** Ensures form quality, reduces errors at events, improves lead quality.
   - **Competitive Gap:** Competitors offer form previews, but none require testing before publish.

### Competitive Risks (Areas of Concern)

1. **Free Alternatives (HubSpot Forms)**
   - **Risk:** HubSpot Forms are free with unlimited submissions. Price-sensitive customers may choose free over $99 per event.
   - **Mitigation:** Emphasize custom branding, professional appearance, event-specific features. HubSpot forms look generic; Event Lead Platform forms are beautiful and branded.
   - **Likelihood:** Medium - Some customers will prioritize cost over quality, but target market (B2B event exhibitors) values professionalism.

2. **Low-Cost Subscriptions (Jotform, LeadGen App)**
   - **Risk:** Jotform Gold at $99/month for 100 forms is cost-effective for high-frequency event exhibitors (10+ events/month). LeadGen App Starter at $19/month is very cheap.
   - **Mitigation:** Your $99 per-event pricing is competitive for 1-3 events/month. For high-frequency customers (6-10 events/year), your annual cost is $600-$1,000 vs. Jotform at $1,188/year. Emphasize event-specific features and custom branding.
   - **Likelihood:** Medium - High-frequency customers may compare costs, but your unique features (custom backgrounds, event org) justify premium.

3. **Event-Specific Competitors (Badge Scanning Platforms)**
   - **Risk:** Cvent, Swapcard, Momencio, iCapture, Captello target the same customer (event exhibitors). They may offer lead capture as part of a broader event management or badge scanning solution.
   - **Research Gap:** Pricing for these platforms is unknown. **Critical Action Required:** Conduct direct competitive intelligence to understand their pricing, features, and go-to-market strategy.
   - **Potential Threats:**
     - If badge scanning platforms offer custom forms for $50 per event, they undercut your $99 pricing.
     - If event organizers bundle lead retrieval tools (e.g., Cvent) in exhibitor packages, exhibitors may use bundled tools rather than purchase Event Lead Platform.
   - **Mitigation Strategy:**
     - **Differentiate on ease of use:** Badge scanning requires hardware (scanners, badges); Event Lead Platform is software-only (works on any tablet).
     - **Emphasize custom branding:** Badge scanning platforms may offer generic lead capture; Event Lead Platform offers beautiful, branded forms with custom backgrounds.
     - **Target smaller events:** Badge scanning infrastructure is expensive for small/mid-sized events; Event Lead Platform is accessible for all event sizes.
   - **Likelihood:** High - This is your most direct competitive threat. **Priority research needed.**

4. **Contractor Baseline ($200 per event)**
   - **Risk:** Your PRD mentions customers currently pay $200 to contractors with 2-3 day turnaround. If contractors lower prices or improve speed, your value proposition weakens.
   - **Mitigation:** Your "form live in 5 minutes" is a massive speed advantage (vs. 2-3 days). $99 is 50% cheaper than $200 contractor. Emphasize speed and cost savings.
   - **Likelihood:** Low - Contractors are unlikely to match 5-minute turnaround or $99 pricing (labor costs prevent this).

5. **Google Forms (Free, Generic)**
   - **Risk:** Google Forms is free, easy to use, and familiar to most users. Some exhibitors may use Google Forms rather than pay $99.
   - **Mitigation:** Google Forms are extremely generic (no custom branding, no event-specific features, no custom backgrounds). Your target market (B2B event exhibitors) values professionalism and branding. Google Forms look amateur; Event Lead Platform looks professional.
   - **Likelihood:** Medium - Price-sensitive or non-professional exhibitors may use Google Forms, but your target market (professional B2B exhibitors) will pay $99 for branded quality.

## Strategic Recommendations

### ✅ 1. ~~Conduct Deep Competitive Intelligence on Event-Specific Platforms~~ (COMPLETED 2025-10-13)

**Status:** **COMPLETE** - Full competitive intelligence gathered for all major event-specific platforms.

**Key Findings:**
- Momencio: $300/event (67% more expensive than Event Lead Platform)
- Captello: $500-$800/event (80-88% more expensive)
- iCapture: $79/user/month or $8,000/year (subscription model)
- Cvent: $300-$600/event (67-83% more expensive)
- Eventleaf: $100-$300/event (comparable pricing, closest competitor)
- Swapcard: $520/year (event organizer platform, not direct competitor)

**Strategic Implication:** Event Lead Platform at $99/event is **price-competitive** and significantly cheaper than 5 out of 6 direct competitors.

---

### ✅ 2. Pricing Validation: $99 Per Event is WELL-POSITIONED (Updated 2025-10-13)

**Validation Complete:** Your $99 per-event pricing is strategically sound.

**Supporting Evidence:**
1. **Undercuts 5 out of 6 Event-Specific Competitors by 67-88%:**
   - Momencio: $300 (you save customers $201 per event)
   - Captello: $500-$800 (you save customers $401-$701 per event)
   - Cvent: $300-$600 (you save customers $201-$501 per event)

2. **Competitive with Budget Option (Eventleaf at $100-$300):**
   - Your $99 matches Eventleaf's lowest tier
   - But you offer custom backgrounds (Eventleaf doesn't) - justifies $99 vs. generic $100

3. **50% Cheaper than Contractor Baseline ($200):**
   - Your PRD cites $200 contractor fee as current market reality
   - You're 50% cheaper + 48 hours faster (5 minutes vs. 2-3 days)

4. **ROI for Frequent Exhibitors (6 events/year):**
   - Event Lead Platform: $594/year (6 events × $99)
   - Momencio: $1,800/year (6 events × $300) - **You save $1,206/year**
   - Captello: $3,000-$4,800/year (6 events × $500-$800) - **You save $2,406-$4,206/year**
   - Contractors: $1,200/year (6 events × $200) - **You save $606/year**

**Recommendation:** **MAINTAIN $99 pricing.** You are well-positioned as the "affordable premium" option - cheaper than competitors but offering custom branding that justifies $99 vs. free/generic alternatives.

**Optional Pricing Strategies (Phase 2+):**
- **Tiered Pricing (Optional):** Consider $149 "Premium" tier with prize draw feature (Phase 2) to increase ARPU while keeping $99 "Standard" tier
- **Volume Discounts (Optional):** Offer $89/event for customers publishing 10+ forms/year (encourages repeat business)
- **DO NOT lower pricing** - $99 is already 50-88% cheaper than competitors; lowering devalues your custom branding advantage

---

### 3. Emphasize Differentiators in Messaging (Go-to-Market Priority)

**Action:** Your marketing messages (landing page, email outreach, demo videos) must clearly communicate your unique differentiators.

**Key Messages to Emphasize:**
1. **"Custom Branded Forms with Your Background Images"** (vs. generic templates)
2. **"Form Live in 5 Minutes"** (vs. 2-3 day contractor turnaround OR complex badge scanning setup)
3. **"$99 per Event, No Subscription"** (vs. monthly subscription fatigue)
4. **"No Hardware Required, Works on Any Tablet"** (vs. badge scanners requiring infrastructure)
5. **"Built for Australian Businesses"** (GST invoicing, ABN validation, Sydney events)

**Landing Page Structure:**
- **Hero:** "Beautiful Branded Lead Collection Forms for Your Next Event – Live in 5 Minutes"
- **Problem Statement:** "Tired of generic Google Forms OR expensive contractors OR complex badge scanners?"
- **Solution:** "Event Lead Platform lets you create stunning, branded forms with your own backgrounds. Pay only when you publish ($99 per event). No subscription, no hardware, no hassle."
- **Features:** Drag-and-drop builder, custom backgrounds, team collaboration, analytics, CSV export
- **Pricing:** $99 per published form per event (transparent, upfront)
- **Social Proof:** Testimonials from beta customers (collect during Month 3)
- **CTA:** "Create Your First Form Free" (emphasizes freemium model)

**Timeline:** Implement in Week 22 (Launch Preparation)

**Deliverable:** Landing page copy and messaging framework for all marketing channels

---

### 4. Target "Better Than Google Forms" Customer Segment Aggressively

**Action:** A significant portion of your target market currently uses Google Forms (free, generic). This is a "low-hanging fruit" segment.

**Why They'll Switch:**
- Google Forms look unprofessional (generic styling, no branding)
- No custom backgrounds (important for brand consistency)
- Not event-specific (leads from multiple events mixed together)
- No team collaboration (each user has their own Google account)

**Marketing Strategy:**
- **Comparison Marketing:** Create "Google Forms vs. Event Lead Platform" comparison page
- **Visual Proof:** Show side-by-side screenshots (Google Form = generic, Event Lead Platform = beautiful custom background)
- **Testimonial:** "I used Google Forms at my last event and collected 50 leads, but they looked unprofessional. At my next event, I used Event Lead Platform with my company's branded background and collected 80 leads. The professional appearance made a difference." (collect this testimonial from beta customer)
- **Pricing Anchor:** "Professional contractors charge $200 and take 2-3 days. Google Forms are free but look amateur. Event Lead Platform is $99 and live in 5 minutes – the perfect middle ground."

**Timeline:** Implement in Weeks 21-22 (Launch Preparation) and ongoing (Month 4+)

**Deliverable:** Comparison page, case study/testimonial from Google Forms switcher

---

### 5. Develop "Better Than Contractor" Messaging for Customer Acquisition

**Action:** Your PRD mentions that customers currently pay $200 to contractors with 2-3 day turnaround. This is your primary value proposition baseline.

**Why They'll Switch:**
- **Speed:** Event Lead Platform is "form live in 5 minutes" vs. 2-3 days for contractor
- **Cost:** $99 vs. $200 (50% savings)
- **Control:** Customer builds form themselves (no back-and-forth with contractor, no miscommunication)
- **Reusability:** Can duplicate form for next event (vs. paying contractor $200 again)

**Marketing Strategy:**
- **ROI Calculator:** "If you attend 6 events per year, contractors cost $1,200. Event Lead Platform costs $600. Save $600 per year + build forms 48 hours faster."
- **Time-to-Event Urgency:** "Event is in 2 days and you forgot to get a lead capture form? With Event Lead Platform, your form is live in 5 minutes. No waiting for contractors."
- **Testimonial:** "I used to pay $200 to a contractor and wait 2-3 days. Now I build my own forms in 5 minutes for $99. I've saved $600 this year and have more control over my brand." (collect from beta customer)

**Timeline:** Implement in Weeks 21-22 (Launch Preparation) and ongoing (Month 4+)

**Deliverable:** ROI calculator, case study/testimonial from contractor switcher

---

### 6. Monitor "Badge Scanning Competitor" Threat and Develop Mitigation Plan

**Action:** Badge scanning platforms (Cvent, Swapcard, Momencio, etc.) are your most direct competitive threat. Develop a mitigation plan.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
1. **Emphasize "No Hardware Required":**
   - Badge scanners require physical hardware (scanners, badges, setup)
   - Event Lead Platform works on any tablet (no hardware investment)
   - Easier for small/mid-sized events (badge scanning infrastructure is overkill for <100 attendees)

2. **Target Events Without Badge Scanning Infrastructure:**
   - Many small community events, job fairs, product launches don't have badge scanning infrastructure
   - Event Lead Platform is ideal for these events (badge scanners aren't an option)

3. **Offer Superior Branding:**
   - Badge scanning captures attendee data from badge (name, company, email) but doesn't provide a branded form experience
   - Event Lead Platform offers beautiful branded forms with custom backgrounds (attendees fill out form on tablet, creating a memorable brand experience)

4. **Integrate with Badge Scanning (Phase 3+):**
   - In future, offer integration: Scan badge to auto-populate form fields, then attendee fills out additional custom questions on branded form
   - Best of both worlds: Speed of badge scanning + branding of custom form

**Timeline:** 
- Immediate (Weeks 21-22): Develop messaging emphasizing "no hardware" advantage
- Phase 3 (Month 7+): Explore badge scanning integration (if competitive threat escalates)

**Deliverable:** Competitive mitigation messaging, feature roadmap for badge scanning integration (if needed)

---

### 7. Consider "Event Package" Tier for Event Organizers (Phase 3+ Strategic Option)

**Action:** Your PRD mentions "Event Package" tier (sell to event organizers as bundled offering for all exhibitors) in Phase 3+. This is a strategic option to counter badge scanning competitors.

**Strategic Rationale:**
- Event organizers currently partner with badge scanning platforms (e.g., Cvent) to offer lead retrieval to exhibitors
- If you offer an "Event Package" tier, event organizers can bundle Event Lead Platform with exhibitor packages
- This gives you distribution channel advantage (event organizer recommends your tool to all exhibitors)

**Pricing Model (Hypothetical):**
- Event organizer pays $X per exhibitor (e.g., $50 per exhibitor for event with 20 exhibitors = $1,000 event fee)
- Event organizer bundles Event Lead Platform access in exhibitor package (exhibitors get free access, organizer pays)
- You capture revenue from event organizer, exhibitors get tool for free (no barrier to adoption)

**Competitive Advantage:**
- Undercuts badge scanning platforms on distribution (if event organizer bundles your tool, exhibitors use your tool by default)
- Scales revenue (one event with 20 exhibitors = $1,000 vs. selling to 20 exhibitors individually = $1,980, but harder to acquire)

**Timeline:** Phase 3 (Month 7+) - Only pursue if MVP is successful and competitive threat from badge scanning platforms is high

**Deliverable:** Event Package tier pricing model, go-to-market strategy for event organizer partnerships

---

## Conclusion

### Key Findings Summary (Updated 2025-10-13 with Complete Competitive Intelligence)

1. **No Direct Competitor Matches Your Unique Value Proposition:** Custom backgrounds + event-based organization + pay-per-publish model is a novel combination. This is a **blue ocean** opportunity. **VALIDATED.**

2. **General Form Builders (Jotform, HubSpot) Are Indirect Competitors:** They serve broader markets and lack event-specific features. **Competitive threat: Medium** (price-sensitive customers may use these, but lack custom backgrounds and event features).

3. **Specialized Lead Capture Platforms (LeadCapture.io, GetLeadForms) Are Not Direct Competitors:** They target online lead generation, not in-person events. **Competitive threat: Low**.

4. **Event-Specific Platforms (Badge Scanning) Were Primary Competitive Threat - NOW MITIGATED:** Complete pricing intelligence gathered for Momencio ($300), Captello ($500-$800), iCapture ($79/user/month), Cvent ($300-$600), Eventleaf ($100-$300), Swapcard ($520/year). **Competitive threat downgraded from High to MEDIUM** - you undercut 5 out of 6 competitors by 67-88%.

5. **Your $99 Pricing Is EXCEPTIONALLY COMPETITIVE:** **VALIDATED**
   - 67-88% cheaper than Momencio, Captello, Cvent (premium event platforms)
   - Comparable to Eventleaf ($100-$300), but you offer custom backgrounds (they don't)
   - 50% cheaper than contractor baseline ($200)
   - Strong ROI: Customers save $606-$4,206/year (6 events/year) vs. competitors

6. **"Create Free, Pay to Publish" Model Is Unique and Strategically Strong:** Low barrier to entry, aligns with event budget cycles, reduces subscription fatigue. **Maintain this model.** No competitor uses this approach.

7. **Australian Market Focus Is an Advantage:** Few competitors offer Australian-specific compliance (GST invoicing, ABN validation). This builds trust and differentiation in Sydney market.

8. **Eventleaf is Your Closest Price Competitor ($100-$300/event):** Must differentiate aggressively on custom backgrounds, form builder quality, and professional appearance. Your forms must look **significantly better** than Eventleaf's generic forms to justify $99.
