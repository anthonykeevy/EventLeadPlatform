## Competitive Positioning: The "Affordable Premium" Sweet Spot

### Price Leaders (Budget Options)
- **Google Forms:** Free (but generic, unprofessional)
- **HubSpot Forms:** Free unlimited (but no custom backgrounds, not event-specific)
- **Eventleaf:** $100–$300 per event (affordable but generic forms)

### Event Lead Platform: **$99 per event**
**Positioning:** "Affordable Premium"
- Cheaper than all premium competitors (Momencio, Captello, Cvent) by 67-88%
- Competitive with budget option (Eventleaf) but offers **custom backgrounds**
- 50% cheaper than contractor baseline ($200)
- Justified premium over free options (Google Forms) due to custom branding and professional appearance

### Premium Options (High-Cost Competitors)
- **Momencio:** $300 per event (badge scanning, gamification)
- **Cvent:** $300–$600 per event (enterprise event platform)
- **Captello:** $500–$800 per event (gamified engagement)

---

## Key Differentiators (What Competitors DON'T Offer)

1. **Custom Backgrounds** - No event-specific competitor offers freeform drag-and-drop with custom background images
2. **Pay-Per-Publish Model** - No competitor uses "Create Free, Pay to Publish" approach (all require subscriptions or higher upfront fees)
3. **Event-Based Organization** - Forms organized by events (matches exhibitor mental model)
4. **No Hardware Required** - Software-only (vs. badge scanners requiring physical devices)
5. **5-Minute Setup** - Faster than contractors (2-3 days) or badge scanning infrastructure
6. **Australian Compliance** - GST invoicing, ABN validation (few competitors offer this)

## Primary Competitive Threats

### 1. Eventleaf ($100–$300 per event) - Closest Price Competitor
**Threat Level:** Medium-High

**Why They're a Threat:**
- Comparable pricing ($100–$300 vs. your $99)
- Also offers per-event pricing (no subscription)
- Badge scanning capability (if event has badges)

**How You Win:**
- **Custom backgrounds** (Eventleaf doesn't offer this)
- **Polished UI and form builder** (Eventleaf has basic interface)
- **Professional appearance** - Your forms must look **significantly better** than Eventleaf's generic forms

**Action Required:** Differentiate aggressively on **visual quality** and **custom branding**. Show side-by-side comparison: Eventleaf generic form vs. Event Lead Platform custom-branded form with background image.

---

### 2. Momencio ($300 per event) - Premium Event Platform
**Threat Level:** Medium

**Why They're a Threat:**
- Established brand in event lead capture space
- Badge scanning and business card scanning (faster data entry than manual forms)
- Gamification features (increase booth engagement)
- Single-event pricing option (no long-term commitment)

**How You Win:**
- **67% cheaper** ($99 vs. $300)
- **Custom branding** (Momencio uses generic forms)
- **No hardware required** (Momencio requires badge/business card scanning setup)
- **Simpler setup** (5 minutes vs. badge scanning infrastructure)

**Target Customer:** Exhibitors who prioritize **cost savings** and **custom branding** over badge scanning speed.

---

### 3. HubSpot Forms (Free) - Generic Alternative
**Threat Level:** Medium

**Why They're a Threat:**
- **Free unlimited forms and submissions**
- Familiar to many B2B marketers
- Strong CRM integration (if already using HubSpot)

**How You Win:**
- **Custom backgrounds** (HubSpot forms are generic templates)
- **Event-specific organization** (HubSpot forms are standalone)
- **Professional appearance** (HubSpot forms look basic)
- **$99 is justified** by custom branding and event-specific features

**Target Customer:** B2B exhibitors who value **professional appearance** and **brand consistency** at events (willing to pay $99 for quality).

## Strategic Recommendations

### ✅ Validated: $99 Pricing is WELL-POSITIONED
- **DO NOT lower pricing** - You're already 50-88% cheaper than premium competitors
- **MAINTAIN $99** as your "Standard" tier
- **Consider $149 Premium tier** in Phase 2 (with prize draw feature) to increase ARPU
