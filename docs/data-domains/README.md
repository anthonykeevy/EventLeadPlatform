## Completed Domains

### ‚úÖ User Domain (October 13, 2025)

**Analysis Complete!** See: [`user-domain-analysis.md`](./user-domain-analysis.md)

**Key Findings:**

‚ùó **CRITICAL GAP IDENTIFIED:** User domain well-designed in PRD but NOT IMPLEMENTED
- ‚ùå No `database/schemas/user-schema.sql` (NOW CREATED ‚úÖ)
- ‚ùå No database migrations (Alembic)
- ‚ùå No backend models (`backend/models/` is empty)
- ‚ùå No auth module (`backend/modules/auth/` is empty)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Company and Event schemas reference User table that doesn't exist (FK constraint failures)

**Key Deliverables:**

1. **Industry Research & Competitive Intelligence**
   - Analyzed: Canva, Typeform, Eventbrite, Slack, Stripe
   - Identified multi-tenant SaaS authentication patterns
   - Documented RBAC best practices (3-role system validated)
   - Invitation flow standards (7-day expiry confirmed as industry norm)

2. **Strategic Recommendations**
   - ‚úÖ **Implement User domain FIRST** (blocker for Company/Event schemas)
   - ‚úÖ **Add missing security fields** (brute force protection, token expiry, session management)
   - ‚úÖ **Add full audit trail** (matches Company/Event schemas - Solomon's standards)
   - üü° **Make company setup optional** (Personal Workspace mode - better UX)
   - üü° **Multi-company user access** (Phase 2 - UserCompany many-to-many table)

3. **Database Schema**
   - File: [`database/schemas/user-schema.sql`](../../database/schemas/user-schema.sql) ‚úÖ **NOW CREATED**
   - Two tables: User (27 fields), Invitation (18 fields)
   - Full audit trail (Solomon's standards)
   - Security features: Email verification, password reset, brute force protection
   - Session management: JWT tokens, logout all devices
   - 7 performance indexes

4. **PRD Gaps Identified**
   - ‚ùå No audit trail fields (UpdatedDate, UpdatedBy, IsDeleted, DeletedDate, DeletedBy)
   - ‚ùå No password reset token fields
   - ‚ùå No email verification token fields
   - ‚ùå No brute force protection (FailedLoginCount, LockedUntil)
   - ‚ùå No session management (SessionToken)
   - ‚ùå No multi-company support (User.CompanyID is single-company only)

5. **Authentication Flows Analysis**
   - Email-based signup with verification (24-hour expiry)
   - Password reset flow (1-hour expiry)
   - Invitation-based team onboarding (7-day expiry, resend capability)
   - Onboarding flows: Company creator vs invited user
   - Issues identified: Mandatory company setup too early, no invitation preview

6. **RBAC Validation**
   - 3 roles: System Admin, Company Admin, Company User
   - Permission matrix documented
   - Role constraints validated
   - Industry comparison: EventLead's 3 roles balanced (Canva=4, Typeform=2, Stripe=5)

7. **Data Governance**
   - Test data: 20 test users covering all scenarios (solo, company creator, invited, locked, etc.)
   - Production data: 2-3 demo accounts for sales/QA
   - Clear labeling: TEST DATA vs PRODUCTION SEED DATA

| File | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `docs/data-domains/event-analysis.md` | Comprehensive analysis (50+ pages) | ‚úÖ Complete |
| `docs/data-domains/event-data-dictionary.md` | Field-by-field data dictionary | ‚úÖ Complete |
| `docs/data-domains/README.md` | This file - summary of deliverables | ‚úÖ Complete |

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Review Schema

```bash
cat database/schemas/event-schema.sql
```

**Key Points:**
- PascalCase naming (Solomon's standard)
- NVARCHAR for text (UTF-8 support)
- DATETIME2 with UTC timestamps
- Soft deletes (IsDeleted flag)
- Full audit trail

### 2. Import Production Seed Data

```sql
-- Connect to EventLeadPlatform database
USE [EventLeadPlatform];
GO

-- Run production seed data script
-- File: database/seeds/production/event_production_seed.sql

-- Verify import
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [Event] WHERE EventSource = 'Curated';
-- Expected: 50 curated events
```

### 3. Test with Sample Queries

```sql
-- Event Discovery - Upcoming public events
SELECT EventID, Name, StartDateTime, VenueName, City, EventType
FROM [Event]
WHERE IsDeleted = 0
  AND IsPublic = 1
  AND Status = 'Published'
  AND StartDateTime >= GETUTCDATE()
ORDER BY StartDateTime ASC;

-- Company Dashboard - My events
SELECT EventID, Name, StartDateTime, Status
FROM [Event]
WHERE CompanyID = @CompanyID
  AND IsDeleted = 0
ORDER BY StartDateTime DESC;
```

### 4. Review Strategic Recommendations

Read: [`event-analysis.md`](./event-analysis.md) ‚Üí **Strategic Recommendations** section

**TLDR:**
- ‚úÖ **Use Hybrid Approach:** Curated database + user-generated additions
- ‚ùå **Don't use curated-only** (too limiting, won't handle hair salon scenario)
- ‚ùå **Don't use user-generated-only** (poor UX, variable quality)

## Data Governance

### Test Data vs Production Data

| Aspect | Test Data | Production Data |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Purpose** | Development/testing | Platform launch |
| **File** | `database/seeds/test/event_test_data.sql` | `database/seeds/production/event_production_seed.sql` |
| **Labeling** | ‚ö†Ô∏è **CLEARLY LABELED AS TEST DATA** | ‚úÖ **PRODUCTION READY** |
| **Characteristics** | Verbose, edge cases, clearly fictional | Clean, verified, real sources |
| **Examples** | Hair salon (no event), cancelled events | Sydney International Boat Show, CeBIT Australia |
| **Source Attribution** | None | ICC Sydney, MCEC, tourism boards |
| **Deployment** | Development environments ONLY | Production deployment safe |

**CRITICAL RULE:** ‚ùå **NEVER pollute production with test data!**

## Industry Research Summary

### Competitors Analyzed

| Platform | Type | Data Strategy | Key Lesson |
|----------|------|---------------|-----------|
| **Eventbrite** | Event discovery | Curated + user-generated | Rich metadata for discovery, but requires curation effort |
| **Bizzabo/Swoogo** | Event management | Organizer-managed (curated) | Exhibitor focus, minimal event metadata needed for lead capture |
| **Meetup** | Community events | 100% user-generated | Low friction, but poor discovery UX and variable quality |
| **Lead Capture Apps** | Booth lead retrieval | Minimal event data | Event is context, not focus - users care about leads |

### Key Insights

1. **Users expect both:**
   - Pre-populated major events (Eventbrite model) for professional UX
   - Ability to add custom events (Meetup model) for niche scenarios

2. **Hybrid is the future:**
   - No competitor does hybrid well (curated + user-generated)
   - Opportunity for differentiation

3. **Event metadata hierarchy:**
   - **Tier 1 (Required):** Name, Date, Location
   - **Tier 2 (Recommended):** Venue, Description, Type
   - **Tier 3 (Optional):** Organizer, Attendees, Media

4. **Post-COVID trends:**
   - 30% of events are hybrid (physical + online)
   - Virtual event URLs now standard field
   - Timezone handling more critical
