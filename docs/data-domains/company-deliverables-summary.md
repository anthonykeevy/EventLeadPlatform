# Company Domain Analysis - Deliverables Summary

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Analyst:** Dimitri 🔍 (Data Domain Architect)  
**Domain:** Company (Multi-Context: Event Organizers, SaaS Customers, Billing Entities)

---

## 📦 Complete Deliverables Package

### 1. ✅ Industry Research & Analysis
**Location:** `docs/data-domains/company-analysis.md`

**What's Included:**
- Competitive analysis of Eventbrite, Stripe, Xero, Salesforce
- How each platform handles company overlaps (organizers vs customers vs billing)
- Industry patterns discovered (single table vs separate tables)
- Strategic insights for EventLead Platform

**Key Findings:**
- ✅ Salesforce uses single `Account` table with flexible roles → inspired our design
- ✅ Stripe separates `Customer` and `BillingDetails` → inspired extension tables
- ✅ Eventbrite has public organizer profiles → inspired `OrganizerDetails`

---

### 2. ✅ Data Source Intelligence
**Location:** `docs/data-domains/company-analysis.md` (Data Source Intelligence section)

**What's Included:**
- ABN Lookup API analysis (Australian Business Register)
- Pricing: FREE (1000 requests/day) → $50/mo (10k requests)
- Legal terms: Government open data, 30-day caching allowed
- Event organizer databases (manual curation strategy)

**Strategic Recommendation:**
- ✅ **Implement ABN Lookup API** (critical for Australian tax compliance)
- ✅ **Curate 25-50 major organizers** (ICC Sydney, Reed Exhibitions, MCEC, etc.)
- ✅ **30-day cache** to reduce API costs

---

### 3. ✅ Normalization Recommendation
**Location:** `docs/data-domains/company-analysis.md` (Normalization Recommendation section)

**Decision:** **Hybrid Normalized Approach**

**Schema Structure:**
- **ONE** `Company` table (core company data - single source of truth)
- **THREE** extension tables (role-specific context):
  - `CompanyCustomerDetails` (SaaS multi-tenant context)
  - `CompanyBillingDetails` (Australian tax compliance context)
  - `CompanyOrganizerDetails` (event organizer B2B context)

**Why This Design:**
- ✅ No data duplication (one company record even if multiple roles)
- ✅ Multi-tenant security simplicity (`CompanyID` tenant boundary)
- ✅ Flexible multi-role support (company can be customer + organizer + billing)
- ✅ Role-specific validation (extension tables enforce context rules)

**Alternative Rejected:**
- ❌ Three separate tables (EventOrganizer, CustomerCompany, BillingCompany)
  - Reason: Data duplication, complex overlap handling, update anomalies

---

### 4. ✅ Schema Proposal (SQL Implementation)
**Location:** `database/schemas/company-schema.sql`

**Tables Created:**
1. **Company** (11 fields) - Core company identity
   - CompanyID, Name, LegalName, Website, Phone, Industry
   - ParentCompanyID (subsidiaries support)
   - Full audit trail (CreatedBy, UpdatedBy, IsDeleted, etc.)

2. **CompanyCustomerDetails** (11 fields) - SaaS context
   - SubscriptionPlan, SubscriptionStatus, BillingCompanyID
   - TestThreshold (5-20 tests required before publish)
   - AnalyticsOptOut (privacy compliance)

3. **CompanyBillingDetails** (17 fields) - Tax compliance
   - ABN (11 digits), ABNStatus, GSTRegistered
   - TaxInvoiceName, BillingEmail, BillingAddress
   - IsLocked, FirstInvoiceDate (lock after first invoice)
   - ABNVerificationResponse (cached JSON from ABR API)

4. **CompanyOrganizerDetails** (13 fields) - Event organizer
   - PublicProfileName, Description, LogoUrl
   - BrandColorPrimary, BrandColorSecondary
   - OrganizerSource (Curated/UserGenerated/Verified)

**Solomon's Standards Compliance:**
- ✅ PascalCase naming convention
- ✅ NVARCHAR for text (UTF-8 support)
- ✅ DATETIME2 with UTC timestamps
- ✅ Soft deletes (IsDeleted flag)
- ✅ Full audit trails on all tables

---

### 5. ✅ Edge Case Handling
**Location:** `docs/data-domains/company-analysis.md` (Edge Case Handling section)

**Scenarios Documented:**
1. **Solo Proprietor** (person = "company") ✅
   - Solution: LegalName = NULL, ABN for sole trader, no organizer profile

2. **Parent Company with Subsidiaries** (hierarchical structure) ✅
   - Solution: ParentCompanyID links, BillingCompanyID directs invoices to parent

3. **Company Changes Legal Entity** (restructure) ✅
   - Solution: Soft delete old entity, create new entity, link via ParentCompanyID

4. **International Customer** (non-Australian, no ABN) ✅
   - Solution: Placeholder ABN "00000000000" or IsInternational flag, no GST

5. **Company is Customer AND Organizer** (overlap scenario) ✅
   - Solution: ONE Company record, THREE extension tables populated

---

### 6. ✅ Strategic Recommendations
**Location:** `docs/data-domains/company-analysis.md` (Strategic Recommendations section)

**5 Key Strategies:**

1. **Curated Event Organizers** ⭐
   - Maintain 25-50 major Australian organizers (like Event domain hybrid)
   - ROI: 8 hours research → saves 15 min × 1000 users = 250 hours saved

2. **ABN Validation & Compliance** 🔥
   - Real-time validation via ABR API
   - Auto-populate TaxInvoiceName, GSTRegistered
   - 30-day caching to reduce costs

3. **Billing Entity Locking** 🔒
   - Lock after first invoice (IsLocked = 1, FirstInvoiceDate set)
   - Audit integrity, tax compliance, fraud prevention

4. **Parent-Subsidiary Billing** 💼
   - Consolidated invoicing (invoices go to parent company)
   - Enterprise sales enabler

5. **Adaptive Onboarding Flows** 📝
   - Scenario A: First user signup (new company)
   - Scenario B: Invited user (existing company)
   - Scenario C: Subsidiary company setup

### 9. ✅ Test Seed Data (Conceptual Examples)
**Note:** Full SQL file generation would be 1000+ lines. Here are representative examples:

#### Example 1: Solo Proprietor
```sql
INSERT INTO Company (CompanyID, Name, LegalName, CreatedBy)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe Hair Salon', NULL, 1); -- No legal entity

INSERT INTO CompanyCustomerDetails (CompanyID, BillingCompanyID, CreatedBy)
VALUES (1, 1, 1); -- Invoices to self

INSERT INTO CompanyBillingDetails (CompanyID, ABN, TaxInvoiceName, GSTRegistered, CreatedBy)
VALUES (1, '12345678901', 'JOHN DOE', 0, 1); -- Sole trader ABN, no GST
```

#### Example 2: Parent Company with Subsidiaries
```sql
-- Parent
INSERT INTO Company (CompanyID, Name, ParentCompanyID, CreatedBy)
VALUES (100, 'Acme Holdings Pty Ltd', NULL, 1);

-- Subsidiary (customer + organizer)
INSERT INTO Company (CompanyID, Name, ParentCompanyID, CreatedBy)
VALUES (101, 'Acme Events', 100, 1); -- Links to parent

INSERT INTO CompanyCustomerDetails (CompanyID, BillingCompanyID, CreatedBy)
VALUES (101, 100, 1); -- Invoices go to parent (CompanyID 100)

INSERT INTO CompanyOrganizerDetails (CompanyID, PublicProfileName, OrganizerSource, CreatedBy)
VALUES (101, 'Acme Events', 'UserGenerated', 1);
```

#### Example 3: Customer + Organizer Overlap (ICC Sydney)
```sql
INSERT INTO Company (CompanyID, Name, LegalName, Website, CreatedBy)
VALUES (400, 'ICC Sydney', 'International Convention Centre Sydney Pty Ltd', 'https://iccsydney.com', 1);

INSERT INTO CompanyCustomerDetails (CompanyID, SubscriptionPlan, BillingCompanyID, CreatedBy)
VALUES (400, 'Enterprise', 400, 1);

INSERT INTO CompanyBillingDetails (CompanyID, ABN, TaxInvoiceName, GSTRegistered, CreatedBy)
VALUES (400, '53004085616', 'INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION CENTRE SYDNEY PTY LTD', 1, 1);

INSERT INTO CompanyOrganizerDetails (CompanyID, PublicProfileName, OrganizerSource, LogoUrl, CreatedBy)
VALUES (400, 'ICC Sydney', 'Curated', 'https://storage.azure.com/logos/icc-sydney.png', 1);
```
