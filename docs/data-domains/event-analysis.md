## Business Context

### Platform Purpose

**Primary Use Case:** Lead capture for companies exhibiting at events (trade shows, conferences, expos)

**User Workflow:**
1. Company User logs into platform
2. Selects the event where they have a booth
3. Creates a custom lead capture form for that event
4. Collects attendee information at their booth (tablet-based)
5. Exports leads for follow-up after the event

### Critical Requirements

**Must Support:**
- ‚úÖ Easy event selection from a maintained database
- ‚úÖ Minimal friction for adding events not in the database
- ‚úÖ Non-event scenarios (e.g., hair salon feedback forms)
- ‚úÖ Formal events with full metadata (venue, dates, industry)
- ‚úÖ Private/personal "events" (invisible to other users)

**Strategic Question:**
> "Should we maintain a curated event database, allow user-generated events, or use a hybrid approach?"

## Industry Research

### Competitors Analyzed

#### 1. **Eventbrite** (Event Discovery Platform)
**What I Discovered:**
- **Schema Approach:** Comprehensive event metadata with strong venue/location focus
- **Key Fields:** Name, Description, Start/End DateTime (with timezone), Venue (Name + Address + Geocoding), Category/Subcategory, Format (Physical/Online/Hybrid), Organizer, Capacity, Status, Media URLs
- **Data Strategy:** Curated + user-generated hybrid
- **Strengths:** Rich metadata, excellent discovery UX, verified organizers

**Lesson for Us:** *Users expect rich event details for discovery, but require minimal fields for quick event creation.*

---

#### 2. **Bizzabo / Swoogo** (Event Management & Lead Capture)
**What I Discovered:**
- **Schema Approach:** Event-centric with exhibitor/booth hierarchy
- **Key Fields:** Event ‚Üí Sessions ‚Üí Booths/Exhibitors, Exhibitor info (Company, Booth Number, Hall/Zone), Registration fields, Lead capture integration
- **Data Strategy:** Primarily curated (event organizers create events)
- **Strengths:** Booth assignment, strong lead workflows, CRM integration

**Lesson for Us:** *Lead capture platforms focus on minimal event context - users already know which event they're at. Booth/exhibitor details are more important than event details.*

---

#### 3. **Meetup.com** (Community Events)
**What I Discovered:**
- **Schema Approach:** Simplified, user-generated events
- **Key Fields:** Event Name, Description, Date/Time, Location (or "Online"), RSVP Count
- **Data Strategy:** 100% user-generated
- **Strengths:** Low friction creation, handles informal events well

**Lesson for Us:** *Minimal required fields enable rapid event creation. Works well for community/informal events but lacks discovery features for formal trade shows.*

---

#### 4. **Lead Capture Apps** (Expo Lead Retrieval, momencio)
**What I Discovered:**
- **Schema Approach:** Trade show booth perspective - event is context, not focus
- **Key Fields:** Event Name + Date (minimal), Exhibitor/Booth Number, Lead fields
- **Data Strategy:** Event metadata is secondary; focus is on lead capture
- **Strengths:** Offline-first, fast lead entry, quality scoring

**Lesson for Us:** *For lead capture at booths, event details are just context. Users care more about collecting quality leads than event metadata.*

Based on competitive analysis, here are the **must-have** fields:

**Tier 1 (Required):**
- Event Name
- Start Date/Time (with timezone support)
- Location (Physical address OR "Online")

**Tier 2 (Highly Recommended):**
- End Date/Time
- Venue Name
- Event Type/Category
- Description

**Tier 3 (Optional but Valuable):**

---

## Data Source Intelligence

### Tier 1: Recommended Sources

#### **1. Australian Venue Websites (ICC Sydney, MCEC)**
- **Coverage:** 100-200 major events/year per venue
- **Quality:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê High (official venue calendars)
- **Access:** Web scraping (respectful, robots.txt compliant) or API partnerships
- **Cost:** Free (public information)
- **Legal:** ‚úÖ Public data, respectful scraping is legal
- **Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **HIGHLY RECOMMENDED** - Perfect for Australian B2B trade shows

**Example Events:** Sydney International Boat Show, CeBIT Australia, Fine Food Australia

---

#### **2. Tourism Board Event Calendars**
- **Coverage:** State/territory tourism boards (Tourism NSW, Visit Victoria, etc.)
- **Quality:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium-High (focus on tourist-facing events)
- **Access:** Public websites, some have APIs
- **Cost:** Free
- **Legal:** ‚úÖ Public data
- **Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **SUPPLEMENTARY** - Good for discovery, may lack booth/exhibitor details

**Example Events:** Vivid Sydney, Melbourne Food & Wine Festival, Adelaide Fringe

---

#### **3. User-Generated Event Submission**
- **Coverage:** Unlimited (users add their own events)
- **Quality:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Variable (depends on user input accuracy)
- **Access:** Built into your platform
- **Cost:** Free (your own system)
- **Legal:** ‚úÖ User-owned data
- **Recommendation:** ‚úÖ **ESSENTIAL** - Fills gaps in curated database

**Example Events:** Small conferences, private product launches, hair salon feedback, niche meetups

---

### Tier 2: Supplementary Sources

| Source | Coverage | Quality | Cost | Legal | Recommendation |
|--------|----------|---------|------|-------|---------------|
| **Event Industry Databases** | Trade show data | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | $$$$ | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è Expensive, consider for Phase 3 |
| **Social Media Scraping** | Event announcements | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Free | ‚ö†Ô∏è ToS issues | ‚ùå Unreliable, incomplete data |
| **Google Events API** | Public events | ‚≠ê‚≠ê | Free (rate limits) | ‚úÖ | ‚ö†Ô∏è Mixed quality, good for discovery only |

---

### Not Recommended (Legal/Quality Issues)

| Source | Why Not Recommended |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Eventbrite API Scraping** | ‚ùå ToS violation - prohibits competitive platform usage |
| **Meetup.com Scraping** | ‚ùå ToS violation - API restricted for commercial use |
| **Purchasing Event Lists** | ‚ùå Expensive, stale data, poor ROI |

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### Option A: Curated Database Only ‚ùå

**Approach:** You maintain a comprehensive database of events; users only select from your list.

**Pros:**
- Professional, high-quality event data
- Consistent metadata (venue, dates, industry)
- Excellent discovery UX (filters, search)
- Builds trust (users see "verified" events)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå **Ongoing maintenance burden** - must continuously update events
- ‚ùå **Coverage gaps** - can't cover every niche event
- ‚ùå **Regional limitations** - hard to cover events outside major cities
- ‚ùå **Doesn't support edge cases** - hair salon, private events, small meetups

**Example Competitor:** Bizzabo (organizer-managed events only)

**My Assessment:** ‚ùå **Not Suitable** - Too limiting for your use case. Won't handle hair salon scenario.

---

### Option B: User-Generated Only ‚ùå

**Approach:** Users create all event records manually; no curated database.

**Pros:**
- Infinite coverage (any event, anywhere)
- Zero maintenance (users do the work)
- Handles edge cases naturally (hair salon, private events)
- Simplest to build (no curation workflows)

**Cons:**
- ‚ùå **Variable data quality** - typos, incomplete info, duplicates
- ‚ùå **Poor discovery UX** - hard to find relevant events
- ‚ùå **Looks unprofessional** - "Why don't you have ICC Sydney events?"
- ‚ùå **Duplicate pollution** - "CES 2025" vs "Consumer Electronics Show 2025"

**Example Competitor:** Meetup (community events only)

**My Assessment:** ‚ùå **Not Suitable** - Users expect to see major trade shows pre-populated. Starting with a blank slate feels incomplete.

---

### Option C: Hybrid (Curated + User-Generated) ‚úÖ RECOMMENDED

**Approach:** Start with a curated seed of major events; allow users to add events with minimal friction.

**How It Works:**

**Phase 1 (MVP Launch):**
1. **Curate 50-100 Major Australian Events**
   - Source: ICC Sydney, MCEC, Brisbane Convention Centre, tourism boards
   - Focus: Trade shows, conferences, expos where lead capture is common
   - Quality: Verified, complete metadata, geocoded
   - Example: Sydney International Boat Show, CeBIT Australia, Fine Food Australia

2. **User-Generated Additions**
   - Required fields: Event Name, Date, Location (just city or venue name)
   - Optional fields: Venue address, website, description
   - Status: "User-Generated" (vs "Curated" flag)
   - Visibility: Public (discoverable) vs Private (only visible to creator)

**Phase 2 (Post-Launch):**
3. **Verification System**
   - Admin review queue for user-added events
   - Community verification ("Is this event info accurate?")
   - Upgrade status: UserGenerated ‚Üí Verified

4. **Duplicate Detection**
   - Fuzzy matching on Name + StartDate + City
   - Suggest existing events when users try to add duplicates
   - Merge duplicates (admin workflow)

**Phase 3 (Future Enhancement):**
5. **Quality Flags & Discovery**
   - UI badges: "Verified Event" (curated), "User-Added" (unverified)
   - Filter by source: Show curated only, show all, show user-added only
   - Rating/confidence scores based on completeness

6. **Automated Curation**
   - Scrape venue websites monthly (ICC Sydney, etc.)
   - Auto-import new events (flagged for admin review)
   - Email admin: "10 new events found, click to review"

---

### Why Hybrid is Best for EventLeadPlatform

| Requirement | Curated Only | User-Generated Only | **Hybrid** |
|-------------|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Handle formal events** (trade shows) | ‚úÖ Excellent | ‚ö†Ô∏è Variable quality | ‚úÖ **Excellent** |
| **Handle informal events** (hair salon) | ‚ùå Not supported | ‚úÖ Supported | ‚úÖ **Supported** |
| **Professional first impression** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ **Yes** (seed data) |
| **Coverage of niche events** | ‚ùå Limited | ‚úÖ Unlimited | ‚úÖ **Unlimited** |
| **Maintenance burden** | ‚ùå High | ‚úÖ None | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Low** (initial seed only) |
| **Data quality** | ‚úÖ Consistent | ‚ùå Variable | ‚ö†Ô∏è **Mixed** (flagged) |
| **Scalability** | ‚ùå Linear growth | ‚úÖ Infinite | ‚úÖ **Infinite** |
| **User friction** | ‚úÖ Low (select only) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Moderate (always create) | ‚úÖ **Low** (select OR create) |

---

### Implementation Strategy - Hybrid Approach

#### **MVP (Launch Ready)**

1. **Import 50 Production Seed Events**
   - File: `database/seeds/production/event_production_seed.sql`
   - Source: ICC Sydney, MCEC, Brisbane Convention Centre, tourism boards
   - All marked as `EventSource = 'Curated'`, `Status = 'Published'`, `IsPublic = 1`

2. **User Event Creation Flow**
   - Button: "Can't find your event? Add it here"
   - Required fields: Name, Date, Location (city/venue)
   - Optional fields: Address, Description, Website
   - Default: `EventSource = 'UserGenerated'`, `IsPublic = 1` (or 0 for private)

3. **Event Selection UI**
   - Dropdown/search: Shows curated events first (sorted by StartDateTime)
   - Filter: Upcoming events only (or show "All Events" option)
   - Badge: "Verified" badge on curated events

#### **Post-Launch (Months 1-3)**

4. **Admin Review Queue**
   - List all user-generated events with Status = 'Draft' or needs review
   - Admin actions: Approve (change Status to 'Verified'), Edit details, Merge duplicates

5. **Duplicate Detection**
   - On event creation, search for similar events (Levenshtein distance on Name + Date + City)
   - Prompt user: "Did you mean 'CeBIT Australia 2025' (already in database)?"

#### **Future Enhancements (Months 4+)**

6. **Automated Scraping**
   - Monthly cron job scrapes ICC Sydney, MCEC events
   - Auto-creates records with Status = 'Draft', flagged for admin review

7. **Community Verification**
   - Users can report incorrect event details
   - Users can upvote/downvote event accuracy
   - High-rated user-generated events auto-upgrade to 'Verified'

## Schema Design

### Event Table - Complete Specification

See: `database/schemas/event-schema.sql`

**Key Design Decisions:**

#### **1. Formal vs Informal Scenarios**

‚úÖ **Formal Events (Trade Shows):**
```sql
-- Example: Sydney International Boat Show
Name = 'Sydney International Boat Show 2025'
EventType = 'Expo'
EventFormat = 'Physical'
VenueName = 'ICC Sydney'
VenueAddress = '14 Darling Dr, Sydney NSW 2000'
City = 'Sydney', StateProvince = 'New South Wales'
Industry = 'Marine & Maritime'
EventSource = 'Curated'
IsPublic = 1
Status = 'Published'
```

‚úÖ **Informal "Events" (Hair Salon):**
```sql
-- Example: Hair Salon Feedback
Name = 'Hair Salon Customer Feedback'
EventType = 'Private'
EventFormat = 'Physical'
VenueName = 'Bella Hair Studio'
City = 'Sydney'
EventSource = 'UserGenerated'
IsPublic = 0  -- Only visible to creator
EndDateTime = NULL  -- Ongoing/indefinite
```

---

#### **2. Hybrid Strategy Support**

| Field | Purpose | Curated Example | User-Generated Example |
|-------|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| `EventSource` | Data quality flag | `'Curated'` | `'UserGenerated'` or `'Verified'` |
| `SourceUrl` | Attribution | `'https://iccsydney.com/events'` | NULL |
| `SourceAttribution` | Credit source | `'ICC Sydney Events Calendar'` | NULL |
| `IsPublic` | Visibility | `1` (public, discoverable) | `0` (private) or `1` |
| `Status` | Lifecycle | `'Published'` | `'Draft'` ‚Üí `'Published'` after review |

---

#### **3. Flexibility Features**

üîß **Nullable Fields:**
- `EndDateTime` - Supports ongoing/indefinite events (hair salon)

#### **3. Event Selection Flow - Form Creation**

**Step 1:** "Which event is this form for?"

**UI Pattern:**
- Search bar: "Search events by name or location..."
- Dropdown with autocomplete
- Show curated events first (sorted by StartDateTime)
- Badge: "Verified" on curated events

**Step 2:** "Can't find your event?"

**UI Pattern:**
- Button: "Add Event" (opens modal)
- Required fields: Name, Date, Location
- Optional: Address, Description, Website
- Checkbox: "This is a private event (only visible to me)"

---

### Expected User Behavior Patterns (Based on Competitors)

| User Type | Expected Behavior | Metric to Track |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Frequent Exhibitors** | Select from curated list (CeBIT, Fine Food) | % of events selected vs created |
| **Small Business** | Create custom events (hair salon, small meetups) | % private events vs public |
| **First-Time Users** | Search by city/date | Search queries, filter usage |
| **Power Users** | Create multiple forms per event | Avg forms per event |

**KPI for Platform Success:**
- **Event Selection Time:** < 30 seconds (search ‚Üí select ‚Üí continue)
- **Event Addition Time:** < 2 minutes (can't find ‚Üí add ‚Üí continue)
- **Curated Event Usage:** > 60% of users select curated events (validates curation effort)

## Product Enhancement Suggestions

### For Product Manager - Roadmap Planning

Based on competitive gaps and industry trends, here are feature recommendations:

---

### **Competitive Parity (Must-Have for MVP)**

#### 1. **Event Search & Filtering** ‚úÖ Table Stakes
- **Gap:** All competitors (Eventbrite, Bizzabo) have robust search
- **Features:** Search by name, filter by date/location/type, sort by relevance
- **Priority:** üî• **High** - Expected by users
- **Effort:** Medium (2-3 weeks)

#### 2. **Curated Event Database** ‚úÖ Table Stakes
- **Gap:** Lead capture platforms (Bizzabo, Swoogo) pre-populate major events
- **Features:** 50-100 major Australian events (trade shows, conferences)
- **Priority:** üî• **High** - Professional first impression
- **Effort:** Low (1 week - import seed data)

#### 3. **Private Event Support** ‚úÖ Table Stakes
- **Gap:** Eventbrite supports private events; most lead capture apps don't
- **Features:** `IsPublic = 0` flag, only visible to creator
- **Priority:** üî• **High** - Handles hair salon scenario
- **Effort:** Low (already in schema)

---

### **Competitive Advantage (Differentiators)**

#### 4. **Hybrid Event Strategy** üéØ Unique Positioning
- **Gap:** Most platforms are either curated-only OR user-generated-only
- **Opportunity:** We do BOTH - curated database + user additions
- **Differentiator:** "EventLead has ICC Sydney events pre-loaded, but I can also add my local meetup"
- **Priority:** üéØ **High** - Strategic advantage
- **Effort:** Low (already designed)

#### 5. **Event Quality Flags** üéØ Trust Signal
- **Gap:** No competitor clearly shows "verified" vs "user-added" events
- **Opportunity:** UI badges ("Verified Event", "User-Added") build trust
- **Differentiator:** Users know which events are high-quality curated data
- **Priority:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium** - Nice to have, not critical
- **Effort:** Low (badge component + filter)

#### 6. **Industry-Specific Event Lists** üéØ Vertical Focus
- **Gap:** Eventbrite/Meetup are horizontal (all event types); lead capture apps don't focus on discovery
- **Opportunity:** Pre-filtered lists for specific industries
  - "Technology Trade Shows in Australia"
  - "Healthcare Conferences 2025"
  - "B2B Expos Near You"
- **Differentiator:** Helps users find relevant events faster
- **Priority:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium** - Post-MVP enhancement
- **Effort:** Low (filter + marketing page)

---

### **Emerging Trends (Future-Proofing)**

#### 7. **Hybrid Event Support (Physical + Online)** üöÄ Growing Trend
- **Trend:** Post-COVID, 30% of events are hybrid (physical + virtual)
- **Gap:** Most platforms support physical OR online, not both well
- **Opportunity:** `EventFormat = 'Hybrid'` with both venue address + Zoom link
- **Priority:** ‚ö†Ô∏è **Medium** - Nice to have for MVP, critical post-launch
- **Effort:** Low (already in schema)

#### 8. **Event Recommendations (AI-Powered)** üöÄ Emerging
- **Trend:** Eventbrite uses ML to recommend events based on user behavior
- **Gap:** No lead capture platform does personalized event recommendations
- **Opportunity:** "Based on your industry (Healthcare), you might like these events..."
- **Priority:** ‚è∞ **Low** - Post-MVP enhancement (6+ months)
- **Effort:** High (ML model, user behavior tracking)

#### 9. **Event Collaboration (Multi-Company Exhibitors)** üöÄ B2B Opportunity
- **Trend:** At large trade shows, multiple booths from the same parent company
- **Gap:** No platform handles "We have 3 booths at CeBIT - share the forms"
- **Opportunity:** Multi-booth support, team collaboration per event
- **Priority:** ‚è∞ **Low** - Niche use case (Phase 2)
- **Effort:** Medium (multi-form sharing, permissions)
