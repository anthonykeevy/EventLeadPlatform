## Overview

The Event table stores information about events where users collect leads (trade shows, conferences) and informal scenarios (hair salon feedback). It supports a **hybrid strategy** - curated database + user-generated additions.

---

## Table: [Event]

### Primary Key

| Column | Type | Nullable | Description | Business Purpose |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|------------------|
| `EventID` | `BIGINT IDENTITY(1,1)` | NOT NULL | Unique identifier for each event record | System-generated ID for referencing events in forms, submissions, and dashboards |

---

### Foreign Keys

| Column | Type | Nullable | References | Description | Business Purpose |
|--------|------|----------|------------|-------------|------------------|
| `CompanyID` | `BIGINT` | NOT NULL | `[Company](CompanyID)` | Company that owns/created this event record | For user-generated events, tracks which company created the event. For curated events, could reference a "system company" |

---

### Core Event Fields

|--------|------|----------|---------|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| `Name` | `NVARCHAR(200)` | NOT NULL | - | Event name | User-facing event title (e.g., "CES 2025", "Hair Salon Feedback") | **Eventbrite, Meetup, Bizzabo** - all use similar field |
| `Description` | `NVARCHAR(MAX)` | NULL | - | Long-form event description | Supports multi-paragraph descriptions, markdown-safe. Used for event detail pages and search | **Eventbrite** - rich descriptions for discovery |
| `ShortDescription` | `NVARCHAR(500)` | NULL | - | Brief summary for list views | One-sentence summary for event cards, mobile views | **Eventbrite** - "summary" field for snippets |

### Performance-Critical Indexes

| Index | Columns | Purpose | Query Pattern |
|-------|---------|---------|---------------|
| `IX_Event_Discovery` | `IsPublic, Status, StartDateTime, IsDeleted` | **Public event list queries** | "Show me all upcoming public events" (event selection page) |
| `IX_Event_Company` | `CompanyID, IsDeleted` INCLUDE `(Name, StartDateTime, Status)` | **Company dashboard** | "Show me all events created by my company" |
| `IX_Event_Dates` | `StartDateTime, EndDateTime, IsDeleted` | **Date-based filtering** | "Show me events in November 2025" or "Show me past events" |
| `IX_Event_Location` | `City, StateProvince, Country, IsDeleted` | **Location filtering** | "Show me events in Sydney" or "Show me events in New South Wales" |
| `IX_Event_Type` | `EventType, IsDeleted` | **Event type filtering** | "Show me all Trade Shows" or "Show me all Conferences" |
| `IX_Event_Source` | `EventSource, IsDeleted` | **Source filtering** | "Show me curated events only" or "Show me user-generated events" |

---

## Sample Data Examples

### Example 1: Formal Event (Curated - Trade Show)

```sql
EventID = 1
CompanyID = 1 (System Company)
Name = 'Sydney International Boat Show 2025'
Description = 'Australia''s premier boat show featuring luxury yachts, fishing boats, marine equipment...'
ShortDescription = 'Premier boat show with 300+ exhibitors'
StartDateTime = '2025-08-01T00:00:00Z' -- UTC
EndDateTime = '2025-08-05T08:00:00Z' -- UTC
TimezoneIdentifier = 'Australia/Sydney'
EventFormat = 'Physical'
VenueName = 'ICC Sydney'
VenueAddress = '14 Darling Dr, Sydney NSW 2000'
City = 'Sydney'
StateProvince = 'New South Wales'
Country = 'Australia'
Latitude = -33.8688
Longitude = 151.2093
EventType = 'Expo'
Industry = 'Marine & Maritime'
Tags = 'Boats, Marine, B2B, Trade Show'
EventSource = 'Curated' -- HIGH QUALITY
SourceUrl = 'https://iccsydney.com/whats-on'
SourceAttribution = 'ICC Sydney Events Calendar'
IsPublic = 1 -- Discoverable
Status = 'Published'
ExpectedAttendees = 45000
OrganizerName = 'Australian Marine Industry Federation'
OrganizerWebsite = 'https://www.boatshow.com.au'
```

**Business Context:**  
This is a major Australian trade show where booth exhibitors would use our platform to collect leads. Curated from ICC Sydney's official calendar, this event has rich metadata, high quality, and is discoverable to all users.

---

### Example 2: Informal "Event" (User-Generated - Private)

```sql
EventID = 42
CompanyID = 5 (Hair Salon Company)
Name = 'Hair Salon Customer Feedback'
Description = 'Ongoing feedback collection for our hair salon customers after their appointments. Not a real event - just a feedback form.'
StartDateTime = '2025-01-01T00:00:00Z' -- Arbitrary start date
EndDateTime = NULL -- Ongoing/indefinite
TimezoneIdentifier = 'Australia/Sydney'
EventFormat = 'Physical'
VenueName = 'Bella Hair Studio'
City = 'Sydney'
StateProvince = 'New South Wales'
Country = 'Australia'
EventType = 'Private' -- Non-event scenario
EventSource = 'UserGenerated' -- User created
IsPublic = 0 -- Private (only visible to creator)
Status = 'Published'
-- All other fields: NULL (minimal metadata)
```

**Business Context:**  
This handles the "hair salon" edge case. It's not a real event - just a context for a feedback form. Private visibility means other users won't see it in the event list. Ongoing (NULL EndDateTime) means the form never expires.

---

### Example 3: Hybrid Event (Physical + Online)

```sql
EventID = 15
CompanyID = 1 (System Company)
Name = 'Australian Healthcare Innovation Summit 2025'
Description = 'Hybrid event combining in-person expo with virtual sessions...'
StartDateTime = '2025-10-05T08:30:00Z'
EndDateTime = '2025-10-06T17:00:00Z'
TimezoneIdentifier = 'Australia/Melbourne'
EventFormat = 'Hybrid' -- Physical + Online
VenueName = 'Melbourne Convention Centre'
VenueAddress = '1 Convention Centre Pl, South Wharf VIC 3006'
City = 'Melbourne'
StateProvince = 'Victoria'
Country = 'Australia'
OnlineEventUrl = 'https://teams.microsoft.com/meet/healthcare2025' -- Virtual component
EventType = 'Conference'
Industry = 'Healthcare'
EventSource = 'Curated'
IsPublic = 1
Status = 'Published'
ExpectedAttendees = 2500
```

**Business Context:**  
Post-COVID trend: Many events are hybrid (physical venue + virtual attendance). This example shows both physical location AND online URL populated.

---

### Example 4: Cancelled Event (Historical Data)

```sql
EventID = 99
Name = 'Tech Summit Australia 2025 (CANCELLED)'
Description = 'Major technology conference - CANCELLED due to venue issues. Retained for historical records.'
Status = 'Cancelled' -- Event cancelled
IsDeleted = 0 -- NOT soft-deleted (retain for reporting)
-- Other fields: Standard event metadata
```

**Business Context:**  
When events are cancelled, we retain the data (soft delete = 0) but mark Status = 'Cancelled'. This allows historical reporting ("How many forms did we create for that cancelled event?") without showing it in active event lists.

---

## Business Rules Summary

### 1. **Hybrid Strategy (Curated + User-Generated)**

- **Curated Events:** High-quality events from official sources (ICC Sydney, tourism boards)
  - `EventSource = 'Curated'`
  - `SourceUrl` and `SourceAttribution` populated
  - Full metadata (venue, geocoding, organizer)
  - Discoverable to all users (`IsPublic = 1`)

- **User-Generated Events:** Users add events not in curated database
  - `EventSource = 'UserGenerated'`
  - Minimal required fields (Name, Date, Location)
  - Can be private (`IsPublic = 0`) or public (`IsPublic = 1`)
  - Variable data quality

- **Verified Events:** User-generated events approved by admin/community
  - `EventSource = 'Verified'`
  - Upgraded after review process

### 2. **Formal vs Informal Scenarios**

- **Formal Events (Trade Shows, Conferences):**
  - Rich metadata (venue, industry, attendees, organizer)
  - Public visibility (`IsPublic = 1`)
  - Specific start/end dates
  - Example: Sydney International Boat Show

- **Informal "Events" (Hair Salon, Private Feedback):**
  - Minimal metadata (name, basic location)
  - Private visibility (`IsPublic = 0`)
  - Ongoing (NULL `EndDateTime`)
  - Example: Hair Salon Customer Feedback

### 3. **Event Lifecycle**

- **Draft:** User created but not yet published (not visible to other users)
- **Published:** Visible in event list, before start date
- **Live:** Event is currently happening (today's date within StartDateTime-EndDateTime)
- **Completed:** Past event (EndDateTime has passed)
- **Cancelled:** Event cancelled (retain data for reporting, don't show in active lists)

### 4. **Soft Deletes**

- `IsDeleted = 0`: Active event (show in queries)
- `IsDeleted = 1`: Soft-deleted event (exclude from queries, retain for audit trail)
- **Important:** Cancelled events use `Status = 'Cancelled'`, NOT `IsDeleted = 1`

### 5. **UTC Timestamps**

- **ALL date/time fields stored in UTC** (Solomon's standard)
- `TimezoneIdentifier` stores IANA timezone (e.g., "Australia/Sydney") for display
- Frontend converts UTC ‚Üí local time for user display
- Example: Event starts at "2025-08-01T10:00:00+10:00" (Sydney) ‚Üí stored as "2025-08-01T00:00:00Z" (UTC)

---

## Data Validation Rules

| Field | Validation Rule | Error Message |
|-------|----------------|---------------|
| `Name` | Required, 1-200 characters | "Event name is required and cannot exceed 200 characters" |
| `StartDateTime` | Required, cannot be in the past (for new events) | "Event start date must be in the future" |
| `EndDateTime` | Must be >= StartDateTime (if not NULL) | "Event end date cannot be before start date" |
| `EventFormat` | Must be 'Physical', 'Online', or 'Hybrid' | "Invalid event format" |
| `EventType` | Required, must be from predefined list | "Please select a valid event type" |
| `City` | Recommended (warn if NULL for public events) | "Adding a city helps users find your event" |
| `IsPublic` | Required (0 or 1) | "Please specify event visibility" |
| `Status` | Required, must be from predefined list | "Invalid event status" |

---

## Query Examples

### 1. **Event Discovery - Public Event List (Upcoming)**

```sql
SELECT EventID, Name, ShortDescription, StartDateTime, EndDateTime, 
       VenueName, City, EventType, EventSource, ExpectedAttendees
FROM [Event]
WHERE IsDeleted = 0
  AND IsPublic = 1
  AND Status = 'Published'
  AND StartDateTime >= GETUTCDATE()
ORDER BY StartDateTime ASC;
```

**Business Purpose:** Show users upcoming public events they can select when creating forms.

---

### 2. **Company Dashboard - "My Events"**

```sql
SELECT EventID, Name, StartDateTime, EndDateTime, Status, EventType
FROM [Event]
WHERE CompanyID = @CompanyID
  AND IsDeleted = 0
ORDER BY StartDateTime DESC;
```

**Business Purpose:** Show a company all events they've created (user-generated) or associated with.

---

### 3. **Filter by City - "Events in Sydney"**

```sql
SELECT EventID, Name, StartDateTime, VenueName, EventType
FROM [Event]
WHERE IsDeleted = 0
  AND IsPublic = 1
  AND City = 'Sydney'
  AND Status = 'Published'
  AND StartDateTime >= GETUTCDATE()
ORDER BY StartDateTime ASC;
```

**Business Purpose:** Location-based discovery (primary filter for users).

---

### 4. **Curated Events Only - "Verified Events"**

```sql
SELECT EventID, Name, StartDateTime, VenueName, EventSource, SourceAttribution
FROM [Event]
WHERE IsDeleted = 0
  AND IsPublic = 1
  AND EventSource = 'Curated'
  AND Status = 'Published'
ORDER BY StartDateTime ASC;
```

**Business Purpose:** Show high-quality curated events only (filter option for users who want verified data).

---

### 5. **Admin Review Queue - User-Generated Events**

```sql
SELECT EventID, Name, StartDateTime, City, EventType, CreatedDate, CreatedBy
FROM [Event]
WHERE EventSource = 'UserGenerated'
  AND Status = 'Draft'
  AND IsDeleted = 0
ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC;
```

**Business Purpose:** Admin dashboard showing user-added events pending review.
