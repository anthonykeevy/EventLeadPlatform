## How to Mark Epic Complete

**When epic is finished and tested:**

```
@bmad/agents/epic-boundary-guardian
Command: *mark-epic-complete
Epic: Epic {{number}}
```

This will:
1. Update this epic-status.md file
2. Mark epic status: PENDING ‚Üí COMPLETE ‚úÖ
3. Lock epic files as forbidden zones
4. Generate protected files list
5. Update story-context template for future stories

## Boundary Violation Log

**Track any boundary violations that occur during development:**

| Date | Epic | Violation | File Modified | Reason | Resolution |
|------|------|-----------|---------------|--------|------------|
| - | - | - | - | - | No violations yet |

**Purpose:** Learn from boundary crossings, improve process over time.

  - Epic 1 (Auth): Authentication
  - Epic 2 (Companies): Multi-tenant filtering
  - Epic 3 (Events): Forms belong to events
