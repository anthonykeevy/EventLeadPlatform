## Technical Preferences & Constraints

### Development Environment Strategy

**Local Development:**
- Local MS SQL Server instance with Epic 2 migrations applied
- Local file storage (simulating Azure Blob Storage)
- MailHog containerized service (email testing)
- Local development server (React dev server + FastAPI with hot reload)

**Production Deployment:**
- Azure SQL Database with Epic 2 schema
- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure Communication Services (email)
- Azure App Service (hosting)
- Stripe (payments)

**Environment Switching:**
- Configuration-driven environment variables
- Abstraction layer for storage (local vs Azure Blob)
- Abstraction layer for email (MailHog vs Azure Communication Services)
- Database connection strings per environment
- Stripe test mode (dev) vs live mode (prod)

### Epic 2 Enhancement Requirements

**Critical:** Anthony has extensive data management experience and requires:

1. **Full Audit Tracking:**
   - Track ALL Epic 2 user actions (theme changes, approval decisions, event modifications)
   - Capture: who, what, when, where (entity type, entity ID, action, timestamp, user ID)
   - ApprovalAuditTrail table with comprehensive logging
   - Immutable audit records (append-only)

2. **Cross-Domain Integration:**
   - User themes affect all UI components across domains
   - Company approval workflows integrate with Events and Forms
   - Event context drives form creation and urgency calculation
   - Form access control integrates with all domain permissions

3. **Performance Maintenance:**
   - Epic 2 enhancements must maintain or improve existing performance
   - Dashboard loading times remain under 2 seconds
   - Theme switching completes within 500ms
   - Real-time updates don't impact performance

4. **Backward Compatibility:**
   - All Epic 1 functionality must remain intact
   - No breaking changes to existing APIs or user workflows
   - Existing users experience no disruption during Epic 2 deployment

### Database Development Approach

**Parallel Development:**
- Database schema extensions designed and developed alongside application code
- Database-first approach (schema drives API design)
- Migration strategy (version-controlled schema changes)
- Seed data for development and testing
- Database unit tests (stored procedures, constraints)

**Version Control:**
- Database migrations tracked in version control
- Schema versioning (Alembic for FastAPI/SQLAlchemy)
- Rollback capability for migrations
- Database documentation (ERD diagrams, data dictionary)
