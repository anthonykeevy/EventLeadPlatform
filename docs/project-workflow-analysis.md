## Technical Preferences & Constraints

### Development Environment Strategy

**Local Development:**
- Local MS SQL Server instance (containerized or native)
- Local file storage (simulating Azure Blob Storage)
- MailHog containerized service (email testing without actual sending)
- Local development server (React dev server + FastAPI with hot reload)

**Production Deployment:**
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Blob Storage
- Azure Communication Services (email)
- Azure App Service (hosting)
- Stripe (payments - same in dev and prod with test mode)

**Environment Switching:**
- Configuration-driven environment variables
- Abstraction layer for storage (local vs Azure Blob)
- Abstraction layer for email (MailHog vs Azure Communication Services)
- Database connection strings per environment
- Stripe test mode (dev) vs live mode (prod)

### Enterprise Data Management Requirements

**Critical:** Anthony has extensive data management experience and requires:

1. **Full Audit Tracking:**
   - Track ALL user actions (create, read, update, delete)
   - Capture: who, what, when, where (entity type, entity ID, action, timestamp, user ID)
   - ActivityLog table with comprehensive logging
   - Immutable audit records (append-only)

2. **Data Lineage:**
   - Track data flow through the system
   - Parent-child relationships (e.g., Form → Submissions, Event → Forms)
   - Transformation tracking (e.g., form design changes over time)
   - Version history for critical entities (forms, company details)

3. **Data Quality:**
   - Field-level validation (frontend + backend)
   - Data integrity constraints (foreign keys, check constraints)
   - Required field enforcement
   - Format validation (email, phone, ABN)
   - >90% valid lead target (quality = retention)

4. **Enterprise Database Design:**
   - Normalized schema with proper relationships
   - Indexes for performance (query optimization)
   - Row-level security for multi-tenant isolation
   - Soft deletes (is_active flags, not hard deletes)
   - Timestamps on all tables (created_at, updated_at)
   - Proper data types (no stringly-typed fields)

### Database Development Approach

**Parallel Development:**
- Database schema designed and developed alongside application code
- Database-first approach (schema drives API design)
- Migration strategy (version-controlled schema changes)
- Seed data for development and testing
- Database unit tests (stored procedures, constraints)

**Version Control:**
- Database migrations tracked in version control
- Schema versioning (Alembic for FastAPI/SQLAlchemy)
- Rollback capability for migrations
- Database documentation (ERD diagrams, data dictionary)

## Special Notes

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Enterprise Data Foundation:**
   - Database must be developed in parallel with application
   - Full audit tracking is non-negotiable
   - Data quality and lineage are first-class concerns
   - Anthony's data management expertise is a strategic advantage

2. **Environment Portability:**
   - Clean abstraction between local dev and Azure prod
   - Configuration-driven environment switching
   - No hard-coded environment dependencies
   - Easy deployment to Azure when ready

3. **Solo Founder Efficiency:**
   - BMAD agentic tools maximize productivity
   - Just-in-time approach reduces upfront work
   - Iterative development with fast feedback loops
   - Ruthless prioritization (MVP focus)

4. **Complex Form Builder:**
   - Most technically challenging component
   - Requires careful library selection (dnd-kit recommended)
   - Performance critical (smooth drag interactions)
   - Architecture phase must detail form builder strategy

5. **Multi-Tenant Security:**
   - Data isolation is critical (row-level security)
   - RBAC must be enforced at every layer
   - Audit logging for compliance and debugging
   - Security architecture is foundational

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

**Risk: 5.5-month timeline is tight for Level 4 complexity**
- Mitigation: Disciplined scope management, no feature creep
- Mitigation: BMAD agentic tools accelerate development
- Mitigation: Just-in-time approach focuses effort
- Mitigation: Weekly progress reviews

**Risk: Form builder technical complexity (undo/redo, collision detection)**
- Mitigation: Proof-of-concept in Weeks 9-10
- Mitigation: Architecture phase explores library options
- Mitigation: Proportional scaling (simpler than percentage positioning)

**Risk: Database complexity (audit, lineage, multi-tenant)**
- Mitigation: Anthony's data management expertise
- Mitigation: Architecture phase designs comprehensive schema
- Mitigation: Database-first approach (schema drives API)

**Risk: Solo founder workload**
- Mitigation: BMAD agents handle workflow orchestration
- Mitigation: Clear prioritization (MVP focus)
- Mitigation: Just-in-time approach reduces waste
