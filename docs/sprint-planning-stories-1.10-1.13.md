## Dependency Management

### Critical Path
```
Story 1.13 (Configuration Service)
    ↓
Story 1.10 (Enhanced ABR Search) - BLOCKED until 1.13 complete
```

### Parallel Tracks (No Dependencies)
```
Story 1.12 (International Foundation) - Independent
Story 1.11 (Branch Company Scenarios) - Independent
```

### Dependency Matrix
| Story | Depends On | Blocks | Can Start |
|-------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 1.13 | None | 1.10 | Immediately |
| 1.12 | None | None | Immediately |
| 1.10 | 1.13 | None | Week 3 (after 1.13) |
| 1.11 | 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 (complete) | None | Week 3 |

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
**Target Coverage:** >90% for all stories

**Story 1.13:**
- ConfigurationService (get_setting, type conversion, caching, fallback)
- Convenience methods (JWT expiry, password min length)

**Story 1.12:**
- ValidationEngine (validate_field, regex matching, precedence)
- Type conversion (phone, postal code, tax ID)

**Story 1.10:**
- ABR client (search_by_abn, search_by_acn, search_by_name)
- Cache service (get_cached, cache_result, cleanup)
- Smart search auto-detection logic

**Story 1.11:**
- Relationship service (create_relationship, prevent circular)
- Switch service (switch_company, update JWT token)
- Access request service (create, approve, reject)

### Integration Testing
**Focus:** End-to-end flows

**Story 1.13:**
- Configuration change → Cache invalidation → New value used
- JWT service uses configuration for token expiry
- Frontend fetches configuration and updates UI

**Story 1.12:**
- Validation API endpoint (valid/invalid values)
- Lookup API endpoint (web properties returned)
- Country expansion service (new country setup)

**Story 1.10:**
- Full search flow (input → auto-detect → ABR API → cache → results)
- Cache cleanup job (create expired entries → cleanup → verify deletion)
- Auto-selection flow (single result → pre-fill form)

**Story 1.11:**
- Multi-company invitation flow (invite existing user → accept → join)
- Company switching flow (click → API → JWT refresh → navigate)
- **🚨 CRITICAL: Data isolation flow (create in Co A → switch to Co B → verify not visible)**

### Performance Testing

**Story 1.10:**
- Cache hit rate validation (target: >40%)
- Response time: Cached <10ms, Uncached <2s
- Concurrent searches: 100 users, no errors

**Story 1.11:**
- Company switch time: <3 seconds (95th percentile)
- Concurrent switches: 50 users, no JWT conflicts

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

**Participants:**
- 10-12 representative users per story
- Mix of technical and non-technical users
- Mix of devices (desktop, mobile)

**UAT Schedule:**
- Sprint 3A: Week 2 (Day 4-5) - Stories 1.13 & 1.12
- Sprint 3B: Week 4 (Day 4-5) - Stories 1.10 & 1.11

**Success Threshold:** ≥80% of UAT scenarios pass with ≥80% of testers

**Critical UAT Gates:**
- Story 1.11: **0 data leakage incidents** (automatic failure if any leakage)
- Story 1.10: Cache perceptibility >80% of users notice speed difference

## Contingency Plans

### If Story 1.13 Delays (High Impact)
**Scenario:** Story 1.13 not complete by Day 7  
**Impact:** Story 1.10 cannot start (blocked)  
**Contingency:**
1. Shift Story 1.10 resources to Story 1.11 (full-time)
2. Allocate additional developer to Story 1.13 (pair programming)
3. Push Story 1.10 to later sprint (descope from Sprint 3B)
4. Communicate delay to stakeholders immediately

### If ABR API Integration Fails (Medium Impact)
**Scenario:** ABR API sandbox/production issues  
**Impact:** Story 1.10 search functionality broken  
**Contingency:**
1. Fall back to manual entry only (already in scope)
2. Contact ABR support for assistance
3. Implement cached fallback (show stale results)
4. Extend Story 1.10 timeline by 2-3 days
5. Consider partial release (name search only, defer ABN/ACN)

### If Data Isolation Breach Detected (CRITICAL Impact)
**Scenario:** Data leakage found during testing  
**Impact:** Release blocked, security incident  
**Contingency:**
1. **IMMEDIATE STOP** - Halt Story 1.11 deployment
2. Escalate to security team and senior developers
3. Root cause analysis (identify leakage point)
4. Fix + comprehensive retest (100% regression)
5. External security audit before release
6. No release until 100% data isolation verified

### If Cache Hit Rate <40% (Medium Impact)
**Scenario:** Story 1.10 cache not performing  
**Impact:** Performance benefit reduced, higher API costs  
**Contingency:**
1. Pre-seed cache with top 100 popular companies
2. Analyze search patterns (identify optimization opportunities)
3. Adjust cache strategy (increase TTL if allowed)
4. Accept lower hit rate if search success rate >90%
5. Plan cache optimization for next sprint
