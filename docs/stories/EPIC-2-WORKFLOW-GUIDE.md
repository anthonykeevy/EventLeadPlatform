## üéØ **Workflow Overview**

This guide provides the exact prompts and processes for Epic 2 development using a story-by-story approach optimized for agentic programming. Each stage has specific prompts and expected outcomes.

---

## üìã **Stage 1: Starting a New Story**

### **When to Use**
- Beginning Epic 2
- Starting next story in sequence
- Moving to next domain

### **Prompt to Use**
```
@sm.mdc Please create the next Epic 2 story. 

Current Status:
- Epic 2 Status: docs/stories/EPIC-2-STATUS.md
- Last Completed Story: [Story ID or "None"]
- Current Domain: [Domain Name]
- Next Story Needed: [Story Title or "Next in sequence"]

Requirements:
- Create story file in docs/stories/ folder
- Create context file in docs/stories/ folder  
- Update Epic 2 Status document
- Ensure story includes comprehensive UAT tests
- Focus on [Domain Name] domain
- Follow BMAD v6 story creation standards
- Include creation summary for quality assurance

Expected Deliverables:
1. Story file: docs/stories/story-2.X.md
2. Context file: docs/stories/story-context-2.X.xml
3. Epic 2 Status update
4. Creation summary (BMAD standard)

Please confirm story creation and provide story ID.
```

### **Expected Outcome**
- Story file created: `docs/stories/story-2.X.md`
- Context file created: `docs/stories/story-context-2.X.xml`
- Epic 2 Status updated
- Creation summary document created
- Story ready for implementation

### **Common Issue: Database Tasks**
**Problem:** Stories may include database setup tasks even when database is already ready
**Solution:** When implementing story, inform Developer Agent that database tasks are complete but need verification
**Example:** "Database migrations are complete up to 018_logging_configuration.py - please verify and skip setup tasks"
