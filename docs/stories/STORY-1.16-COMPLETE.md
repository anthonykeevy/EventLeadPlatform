1. **Verify backend first** (30 min saves 6+ hours)
2. **Think ahead to hero features** (6 hours now > 50 hours later)
3. **Multi-tab testing reveals real issues** (theoretical design ≠ real usage)
4. **Use codes in tokens, not names** (RoleCode not RoleName)
5. **Complete = frontend + backend tested end-to-end** (not just API)
