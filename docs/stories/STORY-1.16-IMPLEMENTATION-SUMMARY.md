## 📝 Story Context Notes

### **AC Changes from Original Story**
The story context file (`story-context-1.16.xml`) showed a panel-based UI with role editing, while the original story markdown (`story-1.16.md`) showed a page-based UI. **Followed Story Context** as the authoritative source (as per BMAD workflow).

### **Design Decisions**
1. **Tabs in Panel:** Added "Members" and "Invitations" tabs for better UX
2. **Role Restrictions:** Enforced in both UI and backend (defense in depth)
3. **Resend Count:** Displayed resend count next to invitations
4. **Confirmation Dialogs:** Used browser confirm() for cancel actions
