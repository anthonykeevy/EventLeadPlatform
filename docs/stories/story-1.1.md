# Story 1.1: User Signup and Email Verification

Status: ContextReadyDraft

## Story

As a **potential EventLead Platform user**,
I want **to sign up with my email address and receive email verification**,
so that **I can create an account and access the platform after confirming my email**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC-1.1:** User can submit signup form with valid email and password
2. **AC-1.2:** System validates email format and password minimum length (8 characters)
3. **AC-1.3:** System prevents duplicate email registration (409 error returned)
4. **AC-1.4:** System sends verification email within 5 seconds of signup
5. **AC-1.5:** Verification email contains secure token link that expires in 24 hours
6. **AC-1.6:** User clicking verification link marks `email_verified = true`
7. **AC-1.7:** System displays success message and redirects to login page
8. **AC-1.8:** User cannot log in until email is verified (403 error returned)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: User records must support future company association
- **Security First**: All passwords hashed with bcrypt cost factor 12, secure token generation
- **Email Service**: Azure Communication Services with verified domain for reliable delivery
- **Async Processing**: Email sending must not block HTTP responses
- **Audit Trail**: All User records include CreatedDate, CreatedBy, UpdatedDate, UpdatedBy, IsDeleted
- **Application Configuration**: Use Application Specification system for token expiration times

### Project Structure Notes
- **Backend**: `backend/modules/auth/` for authentication logic
- **Frontend**: `frontend/features/auth/` for authentication UI components
- **Database**: User table with proper audit trail and email verification tokens table
- **Templates**: `backend/templates/emails/` for email templates
- **Common**: `backend/common/email.py` and `backend/common/security.py` for shared utilities

### Testing Standards Summary
- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ coverage for auth module using pytest
- **Integration Tests**: Full signup flow using TestClient
- **E2E Tests**: Browser automation using Playwright
- **Security Tests**: Token validation, password hashing verification
- **Performance Tests**: Email delivery within 5 seconds target
