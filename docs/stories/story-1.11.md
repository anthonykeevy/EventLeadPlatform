## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints
- **Hierarchical Company Structure**: Parent-subsidiary relationships with proper authorization
- **Company Switching**: Multi-company user support with context switching
- **Access Control**: Cross-company operation validation and approval
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging for all company relationship activities
- **Security First**: Proper authorization for cross-company operations
- **User Experience**: Seamless company switching with proper context

### Project Structure Notes
- **Backend**: `backend/modules/companies/relationship_service.py` and `switch_service.py`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/features/companies/` for company relationship components

### Company Relationship Types
- **Parent-Subsidiary**: Hierarchical company relationships
- **Branch Companies**: Regional or functional company divisions

### Company Switching Flow
```
1. User requests company access → Access request validation
2. Company admin approves access → User gains company access
3. User switches company context → Seamless context switching
4. User performs company operations → Proper authorization validation
```

### Testing Standards Summary
