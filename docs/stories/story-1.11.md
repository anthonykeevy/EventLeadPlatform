# Story 1.11: Branch Company Scenarios & Company Switching

**Status:** Approved  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Lines:** ~700  
**Dependencies:** Story 1.5 (Onboarding), Story 1.6 (Team Invitations), Story 1.7 (Invitation Acceptance)

---

## Story

As a **user working with multiple related companies (branches, subsidiaries, partners)**,
I want **the ability to belong to multiple companies and switch between them with proper relationship management**,
so that **I can collaborate across company boundaries while maintaining separate billing and proper access controls**.

---

## Context

The original tech spec assumed users belong to a single company, but real-world use cases revealed a critical gap:

**Real-World Scenarios:**

1. **Marketing Manager (Head Office) → Branch Event Manager:**
   - Head office manages multiple branch locations
   - Each branch has its own company record (separate billing)
   - Marketing manager needs visibility across branches
   - Branch manager needs autonomy for their location

2. **Consultant/Freelancer:**
   - Works with multiple client companies
   - Needs to switch between client contexts
   - Each client sees only their own data (multi-tenancy)

3. **Franchise Model:**
   - Franchise head office and franchisees
   - Franchisees are independent companies
   - Need relationship for support and collaboration

**Problem Without This Story:**
- Users can only belong to ONE company
- No way to establish relationships between companies
- No company switching capability
- Cross-company invitations fail (user already exists in different company)

**This Story Solves:**
- Users can belong to multiple companies
- Company relationships (branch, subsidiary, partner)
- Company switching with UI
- Cross-company invitations
- Access request flows
- Relationship-aware permissions

## Acceptance Criteria

### **AC-1.11.1: Multi-Company User Support**
- User can belong to multiple companies simultaneously
- `UserCompany` table supports many-to-many relationship
- Each `UserCompany` record has its own `Role` (user can be admin in one company, user in another)
- User has one `IsDefaultCompany` (selected on login)
- System tracks `JoinedDate` and `JoinedVia` for each company membership
- JWT token includes `current_company_id` for session context

### **AC-1.11.2: Company Relationship Table**
- System provides `CompanyRelationship` table to track relationships between companies
- Schema:
  - `RelationshipID` (PK)
  - `ParentCompanyID` (FK to Company)
  - `ChildCompanyID` (FK to Company)
  - `RelationshipType`: 'branch', 'subsidiary', 'partner'
  - `Status`: 'active', 'suspended', 'terminated'
  - `EstablishedBy` (FK to User - who created the relationship)
  - `EstablishedAt` (timestamp)
  - Full audit trail (CreatedBy, UpdatedBy, IsDeleted, etc.)
- System prevents circular relationships (Company A → Company B → Company A)
- System enforces unique relationship per company pair

### **AC-1.11.3: Company Switcher UI Component**
- System provides company switcher dropdown in main navigation (top-right)
- Dropdown displays all companies user belongs to:
  - Company name
  - User's role in that company
  - Relationship type badge (if applicable: "Branch", "Parent", "Partner")
  - "Active" indicator for current company
- User can click company to switch context
- System validates user has active `UserCompany` record before switching
- System updates JWT token with new `current_company_id`
- System navigates to company dashboard after switch
- System shows loading state during switch

### **AC-1.11.4: Company Switching API Endpoint**
- System provides `POST /api/users/me/switch-company` endpoint
- Request: `{"company_id": 123}`
- System validates:
  - User has active `UserCompany` record for target company
  - `UserCompany.Status = "active"`
  - User is authenticated
- System updates `User.IsDefaultCompany` (set target to true, others to false)
- System generates new JWT token with updated `current_company_id` and `role`
- Response: `{access_token, refresh_token, company: {...}}`
- System logs switch event: `company_switched` (from_company_id, to_company_id)

### **AC-1.11.5: Cross-Company Invitation Support**
- System allows inviting users who already exist in a different company
- When inviting existing user:
  - System checks if user already has account (email exists)
  - System checks if user already belongs to inviting company (prevent duplicate)
  - If user exists in different company → Create new `UserCompany` record with assigned role
  - System sends "You've been invited to join [Company Name]" email (different from signup invitation)
  - System does NOT create new User record (user already exists)
- System updates `JoinedVia = "invitation"` for new `UserCompany` record
- System logs invitation acceptance: `user_joined_company` (user_id, company_id, invited_by)

### **AC-1.11.6: Company Relationship Establishment**
- System provides endpoint: `POST /api/companies/{company_id}/relationships`
- Request: `{related_company_id, relationship_type, role}`
- Only `company_admin` can create relationships
- System validates:
  - User is admin of `company_id` (establishing company)
  - `related_company_id` exists
  - No existing relationship between companies
- System creates `CompanyRelationship` record with `Status = "active"`
- System logs relationship creation: `company_relationship_established`
- System allows relationships:
  - **Branch:** Parent company → Branch company (e.g., Head Office → Melbourne Branch)
  - **Subsidiary:** Parent company → Subsidiary company (e.g., Holding Company → Operating Company)
  - **Partner:** Equal partnership (e.g., Event Organizer ↔ Venue Partner)

### **AC-1.11.7: Access Request Flow (Request to Join Company)**
- System provides "Request Access" feature for companies user doesn't belong to
- Use case: User discovers company via invitation or search
- User clicks "Request Access to [Company Name]"
- System creates `CompanySwitchRequest` record:
  - `UserID`, `ToCompanyID`, `RequestType = "access_request"`, `Status = "pending"`
- System sends notification to all admins of target company
- Admins can approve or reject request
- On approval:
  - System creates `UserCompany` record with `Role = "company_user"`
  - System sends notification to requester
- System logs approval/rejection

### **AC-1.11.8: Relationship Context in Company Switcher**
- Company switcher displays relationship badges:
  - "Head Office" (parent company in branch relationship)
  - "Branch" (child company in branch relationship)
  - "Subsidiary" (child company in subsidiary relationship)
  - "Partner" (partner relationship)
- System queries `CompanyRelationship` table to determine badge
- System shows relationship from user's perspective:
  - If user is in parent company → Child company shows as "Branch"
  - If user is in child company → Parent company shows as "Head Office"

### **AC-1.11.9: Separate Billing for Related Companies**
- System maintains separate `CompanyBillingDetails` for each company (even if related)
- Branch companies have their own ABN and billing address
- System does NOT aggregate billing across relationships (future enhancement)
- System tracks billing independently:
  - Company A (Head Office) has its own subscription
  - Company B (Branch) has its own subscription
- System logs billing events per company (not shared)

### **AC-1.11.10: Audit Trail for Company Relationships**
- System logs all relationship lifecycle events:
  - `company_relationship_created` (relationship_id, parent_company_id, child_company_id, type, established_by)
  - `company_relationship_suspended` (relationship_id, reason, suspended_by)
  - `company_relationship_terminated` (relationship_id, reason, terminated_by)
  - `user_switched_company` (user_id, from_company_id, to_company_id)
  - `user_joined_company` (user_id, company_id, invited_by, relationship_context)
  - `access_request_created` (request_id, user_id, target_company_id)
  - `access_request_approved` (request_id, approved_by)
  - `access_request_rejected` (request_id, rejected_by, reason)
- System stores audit events in `audit.CompanyAudit` table
- Audit entries include: timestamp, user_id, company_id, action, details (JSON)

### Testing Strategy

**Integration Tests:**
1. **Multi-Company User Flow:**
   - User joins Company A (onboarding)
   - User receives invitation to Company B
   - User accepts invitation (creates second `UserCompany`)
   - User switches between Company A and Company B
   - Verify JWT token updates with correct `current_company_id` and `role`

2. **Branch Company Scenario:**
   - Admin of Company A (Head Office) creates relationship with Company B (Branch)
   - Admin of Company A invites user to Company B
   - User belongs to both companies
   - User switches from Head Office to Branch
   - Verify Company Switcher shows relationship badges

3. **Access Request Flow:**
   - User requests access to Company C (not a member)
   - Admin of Company C receives notification
   - Admin approves request
   - User receives notification and can now switch to Company C

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

### UAT Scenarios

1. **Multi-Company Invitation Acceptance:**
   - User receives invitation to Company A
   - User accepts invitation and joins Company A
   - User receives invitation to Company B (different company)
   - User accepts invitation to Company B
   - User now belongs to both companies
   - User verifies both companies appear in switcher

2. **Company Switching Experience:**
   - User opens company switcher dropdown
   - User sees all companies they belong to with roles
   - User clicks Company B to switch
   - System switches context in <3 seconds
   - User sees Company B dashboard/data
   - User verifies no Company A data visible

3. **Relationship Context Display:**
   - User belongs to Head Office and Branch Office
   - User opens company switcher
   - User sees relationship badges (e.g., "Head Office", "Branch")
   - Relationship context is clear and intuitive
   - User understands company structure without explanation

4. **Data Isolation Verification:**
   - User creates event in Company A
   - User switches to Company B
   - User verifies Company A event is not visible
   - User creates event in Company B
   - User switches back to Company A
   - User verifies Company B event is not visible
   - Complete data isolation confirmed

5. **Cross-Company Invitation (Existing User):**
   - User (existing account) receives invitation to new company
   - User clicks invitation link
   - System recognizes existing user
   - User accepts invitation (no new account creation)
   - UserCompany relationship created automatically
   - User can switch to new company immediately

6. **Access Request Flow:**
   - User discovers Company C (not a member)
   - User clicks "Request Access to Company C"
   - User provides reason for access
   - Admin of Company C receives notification
   - Admin reviews and approves request
   - User receives notification
   - User can now switch to Company C

7. **Company Switcher Mobile Experience:**
   - User opens company switcher on mobile
   - Dropdown displays clearly on mobile screen
   - Touch targets are easy to tap
   - Switching works smoothly on mobile
   - No layout issues or performance problems

### UAT Success Criteria

- [ ] **Switch Speed:** Company switching completes in <3 seconds (95% of switches)
- [ ] **Data Isolation:** 100% data isolation verified (no cross-company data leakage)
- [ ] **Multi-Company Success:** >90% of users successfully join multiple companies
- [ ] **Relationship Clarity:** >85% understand relationship badges without explanation
- [ ] **Switch Completion Rate:** >95% of switch attempts succeed
- [ ] **Access Request Success:** >90% of access requests completed successfully
- [ ] **Mobile Switcher Experience:** Rated ≥4/5 by mobile testers
- [ ] **No Confusion:** <5% of users confused about which company they're currently in

### UAT Test Plan

**Participants:** 10-12 representative users:
- 4 freelancers/consultants (work with multiple clients)
- 4 branch managers (head office + branch relationships)
- 4 admin users (manage multiple related companies)
- Mix of technical proficiency levels
- Mix of devices (6 desktop, 6 mobile)

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes per participant

**Environment:** 
- Staging environment with pre-configured company relationships
- Test accounts belonging to 2-3 companies each
- Sample data in each company for data isolation testing

**Facilitation:** 
- Product Owner observes, takes notes
- Does not intervene during data isolation tests (critical security test)
- Measures switch time precisely
- Documents any data leakage incidents immediately

**Process:**
1. **Pre-Test:** "You work with multiple companies. Let's see how you manage them."
2. **Task 1:** "Accept this invitation to join a second company" (measure time)
3. **Task 2:** "Switch between your companies" (measure switch time, observe ease)
4. **Task 3:** "Create an event in Company A, switch to Company B, verify event not visible" (data isolation test)
5. **Task 4:** "Request access to this company" (test access request flow)
6. **Task 5:** "Which company are you currently in?" (test awareness)
7. **Post-Test Survey:**
   - Rate ease of switching companies (1-5)
   - Rate clarity of relationship badges (1-5)
   - Did you see any data from other companies when you shouldn't? (Yes/No - critical)
   - Any confusion about which company you were in? (Yes/No)
   - Open feedback

**Data Collection:**
- Company switch time (average, p95, p99)
- Data isolation breaches (target: 0)
- Multi-company invitation success rate
- Relationship badge comprehension rate
- Switch completion rate
- User satisfaction ratings
- Qualitative feedback

**Success Threshold:** ≥80% of UAT scenarios pass with ≥80% of testers

**Critical Security Gate:** 
- **0 data leakage incidents** - Any data leakage is automatic UAT failure and blocks release

**Deviations from Success Criteria:**
- If switch speed >3 seconds: Optimize JWT generation or API performance
- If data isolation <100%: CRITICAL - Fix immediately, retest completely
- If multi-company success <90%: Improve invitation UX or documentation
- If relationship badges not clear: Redesign badge labels/colors
- If access request success <90%: Simplify access request flow
- If mobile experience <4/5: Iterate on mobile switcher design

## Dev Agent Record

### Context Reference

[Source: docs/story-context-1.11.xml]

### Agent Model Used

Gemini 2.5 Pro (initial implementation)
Claude Sonnet 4.5 (test infrastructure and bug fixes)

### Debug Log References

**Migration Issues:**
- Alembic `KeyError: '004'` due to `down_revision` mismatch.
- Alembic `IntegrityError` due to missing `IsDeleted` in seed data.

**Test Infrastructure Fixes (2025-10-18):**
1. **Missing Required Fields in Test Fixtures:**
   - Missing `StatusID` in test user fixture (User.StatusID is NOT NULL)
   - Missing `CountryID` in Company creation (Company.CountryID is NOT NULL)
   - Missing `JoinedViaID` in UserCompany creation (UserCompany.JoinedViaID is NOT NULL)
   - Fixed by querying/creating reference data in fixtures

2. **Application Bugs Found During Testing:**
   - `create_access_token()` missing `db` parameter in switch_service.py
   - JWT token uses `sub` field for user_id (JWT standard), not `user_id`
   - UserCompanyStatus uses `Description` field, not `StatusDescription`
   - `JoinedVia.MethodCode` vs `JoinedVia.JoinedViaCode` inconsistency
   - Jinja2 `undefined` parameter should be `StrictUndefined`, not `UndefinedError`

3. **Database Schema Mismatches:**
   - `CompanySwitchRequestType` and `CompanySwitchRequestStatus` models had audit columns not in database
   - `CompanySwitchRequest.CompanySwitchRequestID` vs `RequestID` attribute naming
   - Fixed by aligning models with actual database schema

4. **Pydantic v2 Migration:**
   - Updated `from_orm()` to `model_validate()`
   - Updated `orm_mode = True` to `model_config = {"from_attributes": True}`
   - Added field aliases to map database columns to API response fields
   - Made `invitation_id` and `expires_at` optional for existing user invitations

5. **Test Authentication Issues:**
   - Created custom `auth_client` fixture to properly decode JWT from Authorization header
   - Fixed dependency override for `get_current_user` in integration tests
   - Added `test_helpers` fixture for consistent test data creation

6. **Reference Data Issues:**
   - Missing `JoinedVia.MethodCode='access_request'` in database (user added)
   - Fixed all `JoinedVia` lookups to use correct `MethodCode` field

**Test Coverage Summary (2025-10-18):**
- ✅ `test_story_1_11_switching.py`: 10/10 passing (100%)
- ✅ `test_story_1_11_relationships.py`: 13/13 passing (100%)
- ✅ `test_story_1_11_access_requests.py`: 12/12 passing (100%)
