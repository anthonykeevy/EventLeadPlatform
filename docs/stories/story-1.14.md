# Story 1.14: Frontend Onboarding Flow (Modal on Dashboard)

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Lines:** ~600  
**Dependencies:** Story 1.5 (Backend Onboarding), Story 1.10 (ABR Search), Story 1.9 (Auth Context), Story 1.18 (Dashboard Layout)

---

## Story

As a **new user who just signed up**,
I want **an intuitive onboarding modal that appears on my dashboard with smart company search**,
so that **I can quickly set up my profile and company details in less than 5 minutes**.

---

## Context

After successful email verification and login, first-time users are redirected to the dashboard. If they haven't completed onboarding, an onboarding **modal pops up as an overlay** on the empty dashboard. This story implements the frontend UI for the onboarding modal (backend APIs implemented in Story 1.5).

**First-Time Login Flow:**
1. User logs in → Dashboard loads (empty state: KPIs showing zeros, no companies)
2. Onboarding modal pops up (overlay on dashboard)
3. User completes Step 1 (user details) and Step 2 (company details)
4. Modal closes → Dashboard refreshes → Company appears

**Onboarding Steps:**
1. **Step 1: User Details** - Name, phone, role/title (optional)
2. **Step 2: Company Setup** - Company search (ABR) or manual entry, billing address

**Key Features:**
- Modal/overlay (not full-page) on dashboard
- Cannot dismiss modal (no X button, no ESC, required before platform use)
- Multi-step wizard with progress indicator
- Enhanced company search integration (Story 1.10)
- Auto-save progress (prevent data loss)
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
