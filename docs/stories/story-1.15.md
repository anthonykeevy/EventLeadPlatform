# Story 1.15: Activity Logging and Audit Trail

Status: ContextReadyDraft

## Story

As a **EventLead Platform system**,
I want **to implement comprehensive activity logging and audit trail functionality**,
so that **all user actions and system events are tracked for compliance, debugging, and security monitoring**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC-15.1:** System logs all authentication events (signup, login, logout, password reset)
2. **AC-15.2:** System logs all user management activities (profile updates, role changes)
3. **AC-15.3:** System logs all company management activities (creation, updates, team changes)
4. **AC-15.4:** System logs all invitation activities (creation, acceptance, cancellation)
5. **AC-15.5:** System logs all authorization events (access attempts, permission changes)
6. **AC-15.6:** System logs all data access and modification events
7. **AC-15.7:** System provides structured logging with consistent format
8. **AC-15.8:** System implements log retention and archival policies
9. **AC-15.9:** System provides log search and filtering capabilities
10. **AC-15.10:** System implements log security and access control

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All user actions and system events tracked
- **Structured Logging**: Consistent format with metadata and context
- **Log Retention**: Configurable retention policies with archival
- **Log Security**: Encrypted storage with access control
- **Performance**: Efficient logging with minimal impact on operations
- **Compliance**: Audit trail for regulatory and security requirements

### Project Structure Notes
- **Backend**: `backend/modules/audit/` for activity logging and audit trail
- **Frontend**: `frontend/features/audit/` for log management interface
- **Database**: activity_log table with proper indexing and retention
- **Security**: Log encryption and access control
- **Analytics**: Log analytics and reporting

### Log Event Types
- **Authentication**: Signup, login, logout, password reset
- **User Management**: Profile updates, role changes, account modifications
- **Company Management**: Company creation, updates, team changes
- **Invitations**: Invitation creation, acceptance, cancellation
- **Authorization**: Access attempts, permission changes, security events
- **Data Access**: Data access and modification events

### Log Structure and Format
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-13T10:30:00Z",
  "event_type": "user_login",
  "user_id": "123",
  "company_id": "456",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "metadata": {
    "login_method": "email",
    "success": true
  }
}
```

### Testing Standards Summary
- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ coverage for activity logging module using pytest
- **Integration Tests**: Complete logging flow using TestClient
- **E2E Tests**: Browser log management using Playwright
- **Performance Tests**: Log operations performance and optimization
- **Security Tests**: Log security and access control validation
