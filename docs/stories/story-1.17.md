# Story 1.17: UX Enhancement & Polish

**Status:** Ready  
**Priority:** Medium  
**Estimated Lines:** ~800  
**Dependencies:** All frontend stories (1.9, 1.14, 1.15, 1.16)

---

## Story

As a **user of the EventLead platform**,
I want **polished UX with comprehensive error states, loading indicators, micro-interactions, and accessibility features**,
so that **I have a delightful, professional experience that meets modern UX standards**.

---

## Context

This story applies UX polish across all Epic 1 features. It addresses AC-14 from the tech spec, which requires comprehensive error handling, loading states, accessibility, and micro-interactions to achieve >85% onboarding completion rate and <5 minute time-to-value.

## Acceptance Criteria

### **AC-1.17.1: Comprehensive Error States**
- System provides error states for all failure scenarios:
  - Network errors (connection lost)
  - API errors (400, 401, 403, 500)
  - Validation errors (inline field errors)
  - Timeout errors
- Each error state includes:
  - Clear error message
  - Recovery path (retry button, support link)
  - Contextual help
- System implements `ErrorBoundary` component to catch React errors

### **AC-1.17.2: Loading States & Progress Indicators**
- System provides loading indicators for all async operations:
  - Skeleton loaders for initial data fetch
  - Button loading spinners for submissions
  - Progress bars for multi-step processes
  - Full-page loading for route transitions
- System ensures no "blank screen" moments
- System displays progress percentages where appropriate

### **AC-1.17.3: Micro-Interactions & Animations**
- System adds subtle animations to enhance feedback:
  - Button hover states (scale, color transition)
  - Form field focus animations (border glow)
  - Success animations (checkmark, confetti)
  - Toast notifications (slide in from top-right)
  - Modal transitions (fade in/out)
  - List item hover effects
- System uses CSS transitions (60fps performance)
- System respects `prefers-reduced-motion` (accessibility)

### **AC-1.17.4: Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance)**
- System implements ARIA labels and roles:
  - Form fields have descriptive labels
  - Buttons have clear aria-labels
  - Error messages announced to screen readers
  - Loading states announced
- System supports keyboard navigation:
  - Tab order logical and predictable
  - Enter key submits forms
  - Escape key closes modals
  - Focus trap in modals
- System ensures color contrast (4.5:1 for text)
- System provides focus indicators (visible outline)
- System tests with screen readers (NVDA, JAWS)

### **AC-1.17.5: Form Enhancements**
- System implements `EnhancedFormInput` component with:
  - Floating labels (label moves up on focus)
  - Real-time validation with debouncing
  - Clear/reset buttons for text inputs
  - Show/hide toggle for password inputs
  - Character count for text areas
  - Auto-formatting (phone, ABN, postcode)
- System provides `useFormValidation` hook for reusable validation logic

### **AC-1.17.6: Auto-Save with Visual Feedback**
- System implements auto-save for multi-step forms:
  - Auto-save to localStorage every 30 seconds
  - Visual indicator: "Saving...", "Auto-saved at 10:30 AM"
  - Restore saved data on page refresh
  - Clear saved data after completion
- System uses `useAutoSave` hook (reusable)

### **AC-1.17.7: Toast Notification System**
- System provides toast notification system for feedback:
  - Success toasts (green, checkmark icon)
  - Error toasts (red, x icon)
  - Info toasts (blue, info icon)
  - Warning toasts (yellow, warning icon)
- Toasts auto-dismiss after 5 seconds
- Toasts stackable (multiple can appear)
- Toasts accessible (announce to screen readers)

### **AC-1.17.8: Mobile Touch Targets & Gestures**
- System ensures all touch targets are minimum 44px (iOS/Android guidelines)
- System adds touch-friendly spacing (16px margins)
- System supports mobile gestures where appropriate:
  - Swipe to dismiss toasts
  - Pull to refresh (future enhancement noted)
- System tests on real devices (iOS, Android)

### **AC-1.17.9: Performance Optimization**
- System achieves performance targets:
  - First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
  - Time to Interactive < 3s
  - Lighthouse score > 90
- System implements:
  - Code splitting (lazy load routes)
  - Image optimization
  - Debouncing for expensive operations (search)
  - React Query caching

### **AC-1.17.10: UX Metrics & Analytics**
- System tracks UX metrics:
  - Onboarding completion rate (target: >85%)
  - Time to value (target: <5 minutes)
  - Error rates per flow
  - Drop-off points in onboarding
  - Form field interaction time
- System integrates analytics (GA4, Mixpanel, or custom)
