# Story 1.18: Dashboard Framework & Container System

**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Estimated Lines:** ~1,200  
**Dependencies:** Story 1.9 (Auth Context), Story 1.11 (Company Relationships)

---

## Overview

Implement the **Dashboard Framework** as the central container system for the Event Lead Platform. The dashboard serves as the top-level container that displays all companies a user belongs to, organized in a hierarchical structure with expandable containers. Users navigate by clicking containers, and KPI components at the top summarize data for selected companies.

**Key Concept:** Dashboard is not just a page - it's a **container architecture** that enables company switching, team management, and data visualization through intuitive interaction with company containers.

---

## User Story

**As a** user who may belong to multiple companies  
**I want** a dashboard that shows all my companies in a hierarchical container structure  
**So that** I can easily navigate, switch between companies, and see aggregated KPIs at a glance

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### **AC-1: Dashboard Layout & Structure**

**Given** I am logged in and have completed onboarding  
**When** I access the dashboard  
**Then** I should see:
- Top-level dashboard container with responsive layout
- KPI component area at the top (placeholder or basic metrics)
- Company container area below KPIs
- All companies I belong to displayed as containers
- Hierarchical structure visible (parent companies → children)

**Visual Structure:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DASHBOARD                                    [User Profile]  │

├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│ │ 🏢 ACME Corporation (Head Office)     [👥][⚙️][▼]     │   │
│ └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│   ├─ 📊 Event: Trade Show 2025 (3 forms)                    │
│   ├─ 📊 Event: Expo Sydney (1 form)                         │
│   └─ 🏢 ACME Melbourne (Branch)        [👥][▼]              │
│       └─ 📊 Event: Melbourne Tech Conf (2 forms)            │
│                                                             │
│ ┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐   │
│ │ 🏢 XYZ Consulting (Freelancer)        [👥][⚙️][▼]     │   │
│ └───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘   │
│   └─ 📊 Event: Client Workshop (1 form)                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Legend:**
- 🏢 = Company container
- 👥 = User management icon (contextual to company)
- ⚙️ = Company settings (only if admin)
- ▼ = Expand/collapse toggle
- 📊 = Event (clickable, leads to event/form management)

---

### **AC-2: Company Container Display**

**Given** I have companies with various relationships (Head Office, Branch, Freelancer)  
**When** I view the dashboard  
**Then** each company container should display:
- Company name
- Company relationship badge (Head Office, Branch, Freelancer)
- User management icon (👥) in header
- Settings icon (⚙️) if I am Company Admin
- Expand/collapse toggle (▼/▲)
- Indication of selected state (active company)

**Company Container States:**
- **Collapsed:** Shows company name, badge, icons only
- **Expanded:** Shows child companies and/or events/forms
- **Selected:** Visual highlight (border, background color change)
- **Hover:** Interactive feedback

---

### **AC-3: Hierarchical Company Structure (Unlimited Depth with Sliding Window)**

**Given** I belong to companies with parent-child relationships (unlimited depth)  
**When** I view the dashboard  
**Then** I should see:
- Parent companies at the top level
- Child companies indented under parents
- Expand/collapse toggles to show/hide children
- Visual hierarchy (indentation, connecting lines, or tree structure)
- **Sliding window display:** Maximum 5 levels visible at a time
- **"..." indicators** for hidden levels above or below
- **Breadcrumb navigation** showing full path (always visible)

**Database:** Unlimited hierarchy depth (no constraints)

**UI:** Display 5 levels at a time (sliding window)

**Example: 10-Level Hierarchy**

**Initial View (Levels 0-4):**
```
🏢 ACME Global HQ (Level 0)               ← Visible
  └─ 🏢 ACME APAC (Level 1)               ← Visible
      └─ 🏢 ACME Australia (Level 2)      ← Visible
          └─ 🏢 ACME Sydney (Level 3)     ← Visible
              └─ 🏢 ACME Sydney CBD (Level 4) ← Visible
                  └─ 🏢 Store 1 (Level 5) ... ← Hint: More below
```

**User Clicks "ACME Sydney CBD" (Level 4) → Window Shifts:**
```
... 🏢 ACME Australia (Level 2)           ← Hint: More above
  └─ 🏢 ACME Sydney (Level 3)             ← Visible
      └─ 🏢 ACME Sydney CBD (Level 4)     ← Visible (SELECTED)
          └─ 🏢 Store 1 (Level 5)         ← Visible
              └─ 🏢 Store 1 West (Level 6) ← Visible
                  └─ 🏢 Unit A (Level 7)  ← Visible
                      └─ 🏢 Floor 2 (Level 8) ... ← Hint: More below
```

**User Clicks "Store 1 West" (Level 6) → Window Shifts Again:**
```
... 🏢 ACME Sydney CBD (Level 4)          ← Hint: More above
  └─ 🏢 Store 1 (Level 5)                 ← Visible
      └─ 🏢 Store 1 West (Level 6)        ← Visible (SELECTED)
          └─ 🏢 Unit A (Level 7)          ← Visible
              └─ 🏢 Floor 2 (Level 8)     ← Visible
                  └─ 🏢 Section A (Level 9) ← Visible
                      └─ 🏢 Desk Pod (Level 10) ... ← Bottom (no more)
```

**Breadcrumb Navigation (Always Visible):**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Dashboard > ACME Global > ... > ACME Sydney > Store 1 West
│                             ↑
│                       Click to jump back
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**"..." Indicators:**
- `... 🏢 Company` (top) = More levels above (clickable to scroll up)
- `🏢 Company ...` (bottom) = More levels below (clickable to scroll down)

**If no hierarchy:** All companies displayed at the top level (flat structure)

---

### **AC-4: Company Selection & Switching**

**Given** I have multiple companies  
**When** I click on a company container (or expand it)  
**Then**:
- The clicked company becomes the "active" company
- The container highlights with active state styling
- KPI components update to reflect selected company data
- Events/forms within the container are revealed (if expandable)
- No page reload (client-side state change)

**When** I click on a different company container  
**Then**:
- Previous company loses active state
- New company becomes active
- KPI components update (smooth transition)
- Context switches seamlessly (<3 seconds)

**When** I select multiple companies (future enhancement)**  
**Then**:
- Multiple containers can be selected (Ctrl+Click or checkboxes)
- KPI components aggregate data across selected companies
- *(Note: This is optional for Epic 1, but architecture should support it)*

---

### **AC-5: KPI Component Area**

**Given** I have selected one or more companies  
**When** I view the dashboard  
**Then** the KPI area at the top should display:
- At least 3 KPI cards (e.g., Total Forms, Total Leads, Active Events)
- Each KPI card shows:
  - Metric label
  - Metric value (number)
  - Optional trend indicator (future enhancement)
- KPIs reflect data for currently selected company(ies)
- Smooth transitions when switching companies (loading states)

**KPI Cards (Minimum for Epic 1):**
1. **Total Forms:** Count of all forms for selected company(ies)
2. **Total Leads:** Count of all lead submissions for selected company(ies)
3. **Active Events:** Count of active events for selected company(ies)

**Loading State:** Skeleton placeholders while fetching KPI data

**Empty State:** "No data yet - Create your first event!" if no events

---

### **AC-6: Team Management Integration (User Icon)**

**Given** I am viewing a company container  
**When** I click the user icon (👥) in the company header  
**Then**:
- A modal or slide-out panel opens
- Displays list of users in THAT specific company
- Shows user name, email, role, status (Active/Pending)

**If I am Company Admin:**
- I can see "Invite User" button
- I can edit user roles (if my role is equal or higher)
- I can remove users (if my role is higher)

**If I am Company User (non-admin):**
- I can see the user list (read-only)
- No edit/invite/remove actions available

**Panel Content:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ ACME Corporation - Team Members                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ 👤 John Smith          Company Admin     [Edit]     │
│ 👤 Jane Doe            Company User      [Edit]     │
│ 👤 Bob Johnson         Company User      [Edit]     │
│ 👤 alice@example.com   Pending (Invited)            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [+ Invite User]                           [Close]   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Contextual to Company:** Each company container has its own team management panel (shows users for THAT company only)

---

### **AC-7: Responsive Design**

**Given** I access the dashboard from different devices  
**When** the viewport changes  
**Then**:
- Desktop: Multi-column KPI cards, full company containers
- Tablet: 2-column KPI cards, full company containers with scroll
- Mobile: Single-column KPI cards, simplified company list (accordion-style)
- Touch-friendly targets (minimum 44x44px)
- Horizontal scroll disabled

---

### **AC-8: Performance & Data Loading**

**Given** I have many companies and events  
**When** I load the dashboard  
**Then**:
- Initial load shows company list within 2 seconds
- KPI data loads asynchronously (skeleton placeholders shown)
- Expanded containers load events/forms on-demand (lazy loading)
- Switching companies updates KPIs within 1 second
- Smooth animations (no janky scrolling or flickering)

**Data Fetching Strategy:**
- Fetch company list on dashboard mount
- Fetch KPI data for active company (default: first company)
- Lazy load events/forms when container expanded
- Cache KPI data (5-minute TTL) to avoid repeated API calls

---

### **AC-9: Empty States**

**Scenario 1: No Companies (Shouldn't happen - user must complete onboarding)**  
- Redirect to onboarding flow

**Scenario 2: Company with No Events:**
```
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🏢 ACME Corporation (Head Office)   [👥][⚙️][▼]  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  └─ 📭 No events yet. Create your first event!
      [+ Create Event]
```

**Scenario 3: User Belongs to Only One Company:**
- Still use container system (consistency)
- Container is expanded by default
- KPI components show single company data

---

### **AC-10: Navigation Integration**

**Given** I am viewing the dashboard  
**When** I click on an event or form within a company container  
**Then**:
- Navigate to event/form management page (Epic 2 scope)
- Active company context is maintained
- Breadcrumb shows: Dashboard > [Company Name] > [Event Name]

**When** I click the dashboard logo in header  
**Then**:
- Navigate back to dashboard
- Restore previous state (selected company, expanded containers)

---

  const selectedIndex = fullPath.findIndex(c => c.companyId === selectedCompany.companyId);
  
  // Calculate visible window (5 levels centered on selected, or offset if near edges)
  const startIndex = Math.max(0, selectedIndex - 2);
  const endIndex = Math.min(fullPath.length, startIndex + maxVisible);
  
  const visibleWindow = fullPath.slice(startIndex, endIndex);

  const path: Company[] = [targetCompany];
  let currentCompany = targetCompany;
  
  // Walk up hierarchy to root
  while (currentCompany.parentCompanyId) {
    const parent = allCompanies.find(c => c.companyId === currentCompany.parentCompanyId);
    if (parent) {
      path.unshift(parent); // Add to beginning of array
      currentCompany = parent;
    } else {
      break; // No parent found (orphaned company)
    }
  }
  
  // Walk down hierarchy from target to leaves (if expanded)
  function addChildren(company: Company, depth: number = 0) {

      addChildren(child, depth + 1);
    });
  }
  
  addChildren(targetCompany, 1);
  
  return path;
}
```

**API Endpoints (Backend):**
```
GET  /api/dashboard/companies           # List all user's companies (hierarchical)
GET  /api/dashboard/kpis?companyIds[]   # Get KPI data for selected companies
GET  /api/companies/{id}/events         # Get events for a company (lazy load)
GET  /api/companies/{id}/users          # Get users for team management panel
POST /api/companies/switch              # Switch active company context
```

---

### **Backend Requirements**

**1. Dashboard API Endpoints:**

**`GET /api/dashboard/companies`**
- Returns hierarchical list of companies user belongs to
- Includes relationship type, role, parent/child structure
- Response:
```json
{
  "companies": [
    {
      "companyId": "123",
      "companyName": "ACME Corporation",
      "relationshipType": "Head Office",
      "userRole": "Company Admin",
      "parentCompanyId": null,
      "childCompanies": [
        {
          "companyId": "124",
          "companyName": "ACME Sydney",
          "relationshipType": "Branch",
          "userRole": "Company Admin",
          "parentCompanyId": "123"
        }
      ],
      "eventCount": 3,
      "formCount": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

**`GET /api/dashboard/kpis?companyIds[]=123&companyIds[]=124`**
- Returns aggregated KPI data for specified companies
- Response:
```json
{
  "totalForms": 12,
  "totalLeads": 145,
  "activeEvents": 5,
  "companyIds": ["123", "124"]
}
```

**`POST /api/companies/switch`**
- Updates user's active company context in session/token
- Request: `{ "companyId": "123" }`
- Response: `{ "success": true, "activeCompanyId": "123" }`

**2. Database Queries:**
- Query to fetch user's companies with hierarchy (recursive CTE)
- Query to aggregate KPI data across multiple companies
- Query to fetch users for team management panel (filtered by company)

---

### **Styling & UX**

**Design System:**
- Use Tailwind CSS for responsive layout
- Consistent spacing (4px grid)
- Company containers: Card component with hover/active states
- KPI cards: Grid layout (3 columns desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile)
- Icons: Lucide React icons (Building, Users, Settings, ChevronDown)

**Animations:**
- Container expand/collapse: smooth height transition (200ms ease)
- Company selection: border/background fade (150ms ease)
- KPI updates: fade out old value, fade in new (300ms)
- Team panel: slide in from right (250ms ease)

**Accessibility:**
- Keyboard navigation: Tab through containers, Enter to expand/select
- Screen reader: Announce active company, KPI values, expand/collapse states
- Focus indicators: Clear visible focus rings
- ARIA labels: All interactive elements labeled

---

## Testing Requirements

### **Unit Tests**

**Component Tests:**
- `DashboardLayout.tsx`: Renders correctly with companies
- `CompanyContainer.tsx`: Expands/collapses, selection state
- `KPICard.tsx`: Displays metric correctly, loading states
- `TeamManagementPanel.tsx`: Opens, displays users, contextual actions

**State Tests:**
- Dashboard state updates when company selected
- KPI data fetches when company changes
- Expanded state persists across re-renders

---

### **Integration Tests**

**Dashboard Loading:**
1. User logs in → Navigate to dashboard
2. Verify companies list loads within 2 seconds
3. Verify KPI section shows skeleton placeholders
4. Verify KPI data loads and displays

**Company Selection:**

- Log in as user with one company
- Verify dashboard shows single company container
- Verify KPIs display company data
- Click user icon → Verify team panel opens

**Scenario 2: Multi-Company User**
- Log in as user with 3 companies
- Verify all 3 companies displayed
- Click Company A → Verify KPIs update
- Click Company B → Verify KPIs update (different data)
- Switch back to Company A → Verify state restored

**Scenario 3: Hierarchical Companies**
- Log in as user with parent-child structure
- Verify hierarchy displayed correctly
- Expand parent → Verify children visible
- Click child company → Verify KPIs show child data only

**Scenario 4: Team Management**
- Log in as Company Admin
- Click user icon → Verify team panel opens
- Verify "Invite User" button visible
- Click "Invite User" → Verify invitation modal opens (Story 1.16)

---

### **Performance Tests**

- Dashboard loads with 10 companies: <3 seconds
- KPI data updates on company switch: <1 second
- Expand container with 20 events: <500ms
- Smooth animations (60fps) on company selection
- No memory leaks on repeated company switching

---

## User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

### **UAT Scenarios**

**Scenario 1: First-Time Dashboard Access**
- User completes onboarding → Redirected to dashboard
- User sees company they just created
- Company container is expanded by default
- KPIs show zeros (no events yet)
- User sees "Create your first event" empty state

**Scenario 2: Multi-Company Navigation**
- User belongs to 3 companies (ACME, XYZ, ABC)
- User logs in → Sees all 3 companies
- User clicks ACME → KPIs update to show ACME data
- User clicks XYZ → KPIs update to show XYZ data
- User clicks ABC → KPIs update to show ABC data
- Switching is fast (<3 seconds) and smooth

**Scenario 3: Hierarchical Company Structure**
- User belongs to ACME Corp (parent) and ACME Sydney (child)
- Dashboard shows ACME Corp at top level
- User expands ACME Corp → ACME Sydney appears underneath
- User clicks ACME Sydney → KPIs show ONLY ACME Sydney data
- User clicks ACME Corp → KPIs show ACME Corp data (not aggregated with child)

**Scenario 4: Team Management Access**
- User is Company Admin for ACME Corp
- User clicks user icon (👥) in ACME Corp header
- Team panel slides in from right
- User sees list of team members (John, Jane, Bob)
- User sees "Invite User" button
- User clicks "Invite User" → Invitation modal opens (Story 1.16)

**Scenario 5: Non-Admin Team View**
- User is Company User (not admin) for XYZ Consulting
- User clicks user icon (👥) in XYZ Consulting header
- Team panel opens with user list
- User DOES NOT see "Invite User" button
- User CANNOT edit user roles
- User sees read-only view

## Notes

**This story is CRITICAL for Epic 1 completion** as it provides the container framework that enables:
- Journey 4 (Company Switching) via container selection
- Journey 2 (Team Invitations) via user icon in company header
- Foundation for Epic 2 (Events & Forms) navigation

**Unlimited Hierarchy with Sliding Window:**
- Database supports unlimited depth (no constraints)
- UI displays maximum 5 levels at a time (performance and UX)
- Sliding window shifts when user clicks deep in hierarchy
- Breadcrumbs always show full path (clickable navigation)
- "..." indicators show hidden levels above/below

**Deferred to Epic 2:**
- ❌ Adding additional companies (after first company from onboarding)
- ❌ Editing company hierarchy (moving branches, changing parents)
- ❌ Billing hierarchy (head office pays for branch forms)
- ❌ Company settings UI (editing company details)

**Epic 1 Scope:**
- ✅ View company hierarchy (unlimited depth, sliding window display)
- ✅ Switch between companies (click containers)
- ✅ Team management (user icon in company header)
- ✅ KPI dashboard (updates based on selected company)

**KPI Component Scope:**
- Minimum 3 KPI cards (Total Forms, Total Leads, Active Events)
- Future enhancements: Trend indicators, time range filters, export
- KPI data will be limited until Epic 2 (Events & Forms) is built

**Multi-Select Companies (Future):**
- Architecture should support multi-select (checkbox or Ctrl+Click)
- KPI aggregation across multiple companies
- Not required for Epic 1 MVP, but should be architecturally feasible

---

**Story Points:** 13 (Large - Complex UI with backend integration)  
**Estimated Days:** 7-8 days

2. **Company Container System** - AC-1.18.3: Recursive component architecture
   - Self-referencing CompanyContainer component
   - Unlimited depth support via recursion
   - Depth-based indentation and styling
   - Expand/collapse functionality
   - Selection state management
   - Icon-based actions (team, settings)

3. **Hierarchy Management** - AC-1.18.2: Sliding window implementation
   - Utility functions for path calculation
   - 5-level visible window algorithm
   - Breadcrumb path tracking
   - "..." indicators for hidden levels (structure ready)
   - Tree building from flat company list

4. **KPI Dashboard** - AC-1.18.8: Dynamic KPI cards
   - 3 KPI cards: Total Forms, Total Leads, Active Events
   - Loading skeleton placeholders
   - Smooth transitions on company switch
   - Returns zeros for Epic 1 (events/forms in Epic 2)

5. **Team Management Panel** - AC-1.18.7: Contextual team display
   - Slides in from right
   - Shows users for clicked company
   - Admin vs non-admin action differentiation
   - Invite button for admins
   - User role and status badges

6. **Backend APIs Created:**
   - GET /api/dashboard/kpis - KPI data aggregation
   - GET /api/companies/{id}/users - Team members list
   - Integrated with existing: GET /api/users/me/companies, POST /api/users/me/switch-company

7. **Navigation & UX** - AC-1.18.5, AC-1.18.10:
   - Breadcrumb navigation with full path
   - Company selection and switching
   - Expand/collapse containers
   - Empty states for various scenarios
   - Responsive design (grid layouts)

8. **Testing:**
   - Frontend: hierarchy utils tests, dashboard layout tests, company container tests
   - Backend: KPI endpoint tests, company users endpoint tests
   - All tests validate acceptance criteria

**Technical Decisions:**

- Used recursive CompanyContainer component for unlimited hierarchy depth
- Implemented sliding window algorithm for 5-level display (performance + UX)
- KPI data returns zeros for Epic 1 (events/forms tables don't exist yet)
- Team panel slides in from right (contextual to clicked company)
- Breadcrumbs always show full path (unlimited depth support)
- Used @tanstack/react-query pattern (ready for caching in future)
