**Status:** ✅ Complete - UAT Passed
**Priority:** High
**Estimate:** 2 Story Points (Original: 2-3 hours)
**Actual Effort:** 12 hours (Expanded to full international architecture)
**Dependencies:** Story 1.12 (Backend Validation Service) ✅
**UAT Date:** 2025-10-23
**UAT Result:** All tests passed across 5 countries

## Story

As a **Frontend Developer**,
I want to **implement the country-specific validation UI components (`PhoneInput`, `PostalCodeInput`) and hooks**,
so that **the user gets real-time, country-aware validation feedback in the onboarding form**.

---

## Context

This story covers the deferred frontend tasks from Story 1.12. The backend validation API is complete and ready for integration. This story involves creating the reusable UI components that provide real-time validation for user inputs like phone numbers and postal codes.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

-   **AC-1.20.1:** Create `useValidationRules.ts` hook to fetch validation rules from the API.
-   **AC-1.20.2:** Create a dynamic `PhoneInput.tsx` component that uses the validation hook.
-   **AC-1.20.3:** Create a dynamic `PostalCodeInput.tsx` component.
-   **AC-1.20.4:** Components must display clear, user-friendly error messages and example values returned from the API.
-   **AC-1.20.5:** Ensure the components are responsive and mobile-optimized.

---

## Dev Notes

-   Reference the frontend architecture and component specifications in `docs/stories/story-1.12.md`.
-   These components will be integrated into the main onboarding form in Story 1.14.

## Session Notes & Learnings

**Date:** 2025-10-23  
**Session Duration:** ~12 hours (multiple iterations)  
**Participants:** Anthony Keevy (PO/UAT), Amelia (Dev Agent), Solomon (Database Validator)

### **Features Added Beyond Original Story**

**Original Story Scope (AC-1.20.1 through AC-1.20.5):**
- PhoneInput component
- PostalCodeInput component
- useValidationRules hook
- Integration into onboarding

**Expanded Scope (PO Approved During Session):**

1. **Company-Level Validation Configuration**
   - CompanyValidationRule table
   - EventLeads company with custom validation rules
   - Architecture for per-company rule customization
   - **Why Added:** Needed to reject toll-free/premium numbers for EventLeads while allowing them for other companies

2. **International Country Support (5 Countries)**
   - Seeded: AU, NZ, US, UK, CA with complete metadata
   - 25+ telco-specific phone validation rules
   - Country-specific postal code rules
   - **Why Added:** "Don't want to defer again" - build international foundation now

3. **Local Display Format Architecture**
   - DisplayFormat, DisplayExample, StripPrefix, SpacingPattern columns
   - Backend calculates display values
   - Stores international (+61...), displays local (04...)
   - **Why Added:** PO insight - users seeing +61 might think data going overseas (trust issue)

4. **Country Auto-Detection**
   - Browser timezone detection
   - Phone prefix detection (+61 → Australia)
   - **Why Added:** Improve UX, reduce friction

5. **Dynamic Country Loading**
   - GET /api/countries endpoint
   - Frontend fetches countries from database
   - No hardcoded country IDs
   - **Why Added:** Discovered CountryID mismatch (expected 1-5, actual 1,14,15,16,17)

6. **Dynamic Labels Per Country**
   - ABN (AU) → EIN (US) → NZBN (NZ) → VAT (UK) → BN (CA)
   - Postcode → ZIP Code → Postal Code
   - State → Province → Region → County
   - **Why Added:** PO question - "What is ABN in other countries?"

7. **Frontend-Backend Alignment Mechanism**
   - maxLength fetched from backend (not hardcoded)
   - Validation metadata endpoint
   - Single source of truth: database
   - **Why Added:** Discovered maxLength=4 hardcoded, but USA needs 10

8. **SortOrder Column Standardization**
   - Migrated from Priority to SortOrder
   - Consistent with other 15 tables
   - **Why Added:** Solomon identified inconsistency during migration review

---

### **Issues Found in Previous Stories**

**Issue #1: Story 1.4 (Backend Password Reset) - Already fixed in Story 1.15**
- Email template variables mismatch
- Wrong frontend URL in reset link
- **Impact on Story 1.20:** None (already resolved)

**Issue #2: Story 1.12 (Backend Validation) - Fixed in Story 1.20**
- Used `Priority` column instead of standard `SortOrder`
- Missing postal code rules for NZ, US, UK, CA
- Phone rules only accepted international format (+61), not local (04...)
- **Fix:** Migration 009 added SortOrder, Migration 010 added postal codes

**Issue #3: Validation Engine Too Permissive**
- `_basic_validation()` returned `is_valid=True` for any non-empty value
- When no rules found, accepted everything
- **Fix:** Changed to return error when no rules configured

**Issue #4: Validation Engine Used Wrong Column**
- Code queried `ValidationRule.Priority`
- Database now uses `ValidationRule.SortOrder`
- **Fix:** Updated query to use SortOrder

### **Test Cases Executed During UAT**

**Phone Validation Tests:**
1. ✅ Valid Australian mobile (0412345678) → Accepts, displays local
2. ✅ Invalid Australian mobile (04147852 - too short) → Rejects with clear error
3. ✅ Australian landline (0298765432) → Accepts
4. ✅ International format (+61412345678) → Accepts, converts to local display
5. ✅ Country change Australia → New Zealand → Phone validation changes
6. ✅ NZ mobile (0212345678) → Validates against NZ rules
7. ✅ UK mobile (07912345678) → Normalizes to +44..., displays as 07...
8. ✅ USA phone (4155551234) → Normalizes to +1..., displays without prefix
9. ✅ Canada phone (4165551234) → Works correctly
10. ✅ Toll-free number (1800123456) → Rejected for EventLeads company

**Postal Code Validation Tests:**

5. ✅ UK postcode (SW1A 1AA) → Valid
6. ✅ NZ postcode (1010) → Valid
7. ✅ Canada postal code (M5H 2N2) → Valid

**Country Selection Tests:**
1. ✅ Auto-detection from browser timezone
2. ✅ Manual country change
3. ✅ Country passes from Step 1 → Step 2
4. ✅ Labels change per country (ABN → EIN → VAT)
5. ✅ State/Province options change per country

**Frontend-Backend Alignment Tests:**

### **Key Learnings for Future Stories**

**1. Scope Creep is Sometimes Good**
- Original: 2-3 hours for simple components
- Final: 12 hours for international architecture
- **Learning:** When PO says "do it properly now", invest the time upfront
- **Benefit:** Zero technical debt, international-ready

**2. UAT Uncovers Architectural Issues**
- Unit tests: 42/42 passing (all mocked)
- UAT: Found 8 bugs (integration, alignment, config issues)
- **Learning:** Unit tests + UAT are both essential
- **Can't skip UAT even with 100% unit test coverage**

**3. Database as Single Source of Truth**
- Hardcoded frontend values caused misalignment
- Dynamic loading from API solved sync issues
- **Learning:** Never hardcode what should come from database
- **Pattern:** Always fetch configuration from backend

**4. International from Day One**
- Building for Australia only = rework later
- Building for 5 countries = works everywhere
- **Learning:** International foundations cost 3x upfront, save 10x later

**5. Product Owner Domain Knowledge Critical**
- "Australians seeing +61 might distrust" - key UX insight
- "What's ABN in other countries?" - revealed scope gap
- **Learning:** PO insights during development prevent customer issues

**6. Systematic Debugging Essential**
- Database → Backend → Frontend layered approach
- SQL queries to verify data exists
- API tests to verify backend logic
- **Learning:** Debug systematically, not randomly

**7. Documentation as You Build**
- Created validation architecture guide during debugging
- Documented alignment mechanism when fixing bugs
- **Learning:** Write docs when context is fresh, not after

**8. Migration Rollback Must Work**
- First migration 009 had wrong downgrade order
- **Learning:** Test downgrade, not just upgrade
- **Fix:** Delete child records before parent (FK constraints)

### **Process Improvements for Epic 1 Retrospective**

**What Worked Well:**
1. ✅ PO involved in UAT (caught UX issues developers wouldn't)
2. ✅ Iterative bug fixing (fix immediately, don't defer)
3. ✅ Solomon review (database standards compliance)
4. ✅ Architecture documents created during implementation
5. ✅ "Do it properly now" mindset (avoided technical debt)

**What Could Improve:**
1. ⚠️ Better scope estimation (2 hours → 12 hours)
2. ⚠️ Validate Story 1.12 completeness before starting Story 1.20
3. ⚠️ Check existing data (Country table IDs) before hardcoding
4. ⚠️ Test migration downgrade, not just upgrade
5. ⚠️ Create validation metadata endpoint in Story 1.12 (not retrofit in Story 1.20)

**Recommendations for Remaining Stories:**
1. Review backend story completeness before starting frontend
2. Test with real data (not mocked) during backend UAT
3. Assume international from start (don't assume Australia-only)
4. Fetch configuration from API (don't hardcode)
5. Build alignment mechanisms upfront (not retrofit)
