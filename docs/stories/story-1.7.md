## Dev Notes

**Invitation Acceptance Flows:**

**Flow 1: Existing User**
```
1. User receives invitation email
2. User clicks invitation link
3. Frontend shows invitation details (company, role)
4. User clicks "Accept Invitation"
5. Frontend redirects to login (if not logged in)
6. User logs in
7. Frontend calls POST /api/invitations/{token}/accept
8. Backend creates UserCompany relationship
9. Backend issues new JWT with updated role/company
10. Frontend redirects to dashboard
```

**Flow 2: New User**
```
1. User receives invitation email
2. User clicks invitation link
3. Frontend shows invitation details
4. User clicks "Sign Up"
5. Frontend redirects to signup with invitation_token param
6. User completes signup form
7. User verifies email
8. Backend auto-accepts invitation after verification
9. Backend creates User and UserCompany together
10. Backend issues JWT with role and company_id
11. Frontend redirects to dashboard (onboarding skipped)
```

**Multi-Company Support:**
```python
# User can belong to multiple companies
user_companies = db.query(UserCompany).filter(
    UserCompany.UserID == user_id,
    UserCompany.IsActive == True
).all()

# Switch company
@router.post("/users/me/switch-company")
async def switch_company(
    request: SwitchCompanyRequest,
    current_user: CurrentUser = Depends(get_current_user),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db)
):
    # Verify user belongs to company
    user_company = db.query(UserCompany).filter(
        UserCompany.UserID == current_user.user_id,
        UserCompany.CompanyID == request.company_id,
        UserCompany.IsActive == True
    ).first()
    
    if not user_company:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=403, detail="Access denied")
    
    # Issue new JWT with new company context
    new_token = create_access_token(
        user_id=current_user.user_id,
        email=current_user.email,
        role=user_company.Role,
        company_id=user_company.CompanyID
    )
    
    return {"access_token": new_token}
```
