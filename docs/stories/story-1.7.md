# Story 1.7: RBAC Middleware and Authorization

Status: ContextReadyDraft

## Story

As a **EventLead Platform system**,
I want **to enforce role-based access control across all protected endpoints**,
so that **users can only access resources and perform actions appropriate to their role**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC-7.1:** System validates JWT tokens on all protected endpoints
2. **AC-7.2:** System extracts user information from JWT claims (user_id, role, company_id)
3. **AC-7.3:** System enforces role-based permissions for different endpoint access
4. **AC-7.4:** Company Admin can access all company resources and team management
5. **AC-7.5:** Company User can access limited company resources (no team management)
6. **AC-7.6:** System returns 401 error for invalid or expired tokens
7. **AC-7.7:** System returns 403 error for insufficient permissions

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints
- **JWT-based Authentication**: Stateless token validation with role information
- **Role-based Access Control**: Three-tier role system with defined permissions
- **Multi-tenant Isolation**: Company-specific data access and filtering
- **Middleware Architecture**: Centralized authorization enforcement
- **Security First**: Comprehensive error handling and security logging
- **Permission-based Access**: Granular permission checking for different operations

### Project Structure Notes
- **Backend**: `backend/modules/auth/middleware.py` for authorization middleware
- **Frontend**: `frontend/features/auth/` for authorization context and components
- **Service Layer**: Authorization checks integrated into all service functions
- **Database**: Company_id filtering for all company-specific resources
- **Security**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring for authorization events

### Role Definitions
- **System Admin**: Platform-wide access (backend only for MVP)
- **Company Admin**: Full company access, team management, billing
- **Company User**: Limited company access, no team management

### Permission Matrix
```
Resource                | System Admin | Company Admin | Company User
------------------------|--------------|---------------|-------------
User Management         | ✅           | ✅            | ❌
Team Management         | ✅           | ✅            | ❌
Company Settings        | ✅           | ✅            | ❌
Event Management        | ✅           | ✅            | ✅
Form Management         | ✅           | ✅            | ✅
Analytics               | ✅           | ✅            | ✅
Billing                 | ✅           | ✅            | ❌
```

### Testing Standards Summary
- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ coverage for authorization middleware using pytest
- **Integration Tests**: Protected endpoint access using TestClient
- **E2E Tests**: Browser authorization scenarios using Playwright
- **Security Tests**: Privilege escalation prevention and token validation
- **Performance Tests**: Authorization middleware response times
