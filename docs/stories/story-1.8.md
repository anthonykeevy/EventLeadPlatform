# Story 1.8: Multi-tenant Data Isolation

Status: ContextReadyDraft

## Story

As a **EventLead Platform system**,
I want **to ensure complete data isolation between companies**,
so that **companies can only access their own data and cannot see or modify other companies' information**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC-8.1:** All company-specific database queries include company_id filtering
2. **AC-8.2:** System prevents cross-company data access in all service layer functions
3. **AC-8.3:** API endpoints automatically filter results by authenticated user's company_id
4. **AC-8.4:** System logs all cross-company access attempts for security monitoring
5. **AC-8.5:** Database queries cannot return data from other companies under any circumstances

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Complete data isolation between companies
- **Company-based Filtering**: All data access filtered by company_id
- **Security First**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring for isolation
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient filtering with proper indexing
- **Database-level Security**: Row-level security and constraints
- **Service Layer Isolation**: Company context injection and validation

### Project Structure Notes
- **Backend**: Company filtering integrated into all service layer functions
- **Database**: Company_id foreign keys and constraints on all company-specific tables
- **API Layer**: Automatic company filtering in all endpoints
- **Security**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring for isolation events
- **Frontend**: Company context management and validation

### Multi-tenant Data Model
```
Company (Root Entity)
├── Users (company_id FK)
├── Events (company_id FK)
├── Forms (company_id FK)
├── Invitations (company_id FK)
└── All other company-specific data
```

### Isolation Strategies
- **Database Level**: Row-level security policies and constraints
- **Service Level**: Company context injection and validation
- **API Level**: Automatic company filtering in all endpoints
- **Frontend Level**: Company context management and validation

### Testing Standards Summary
- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ coverage for multi-tenant isolation using pytest
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-company access prevention using TestClient
- **E2E Tests**: Multi-tenant scenarios using Playwright
- **Security Tests**: Isolation boundary enforcement and data leakage prevention
- **Performance Tests**: Company filtering efficiency and query optimization

### Security Considerations
- **Data Isolation**: Complete separation of company data
- **Access Control**: Company-based authorization for all operations
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all data access
- **Monitoring**: Real-time alerting for isolation violations
- **Performance**: Efficient filtering without compromising security
