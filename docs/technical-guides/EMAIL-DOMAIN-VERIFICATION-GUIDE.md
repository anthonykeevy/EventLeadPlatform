# Email Domain Verification Guide
**Story 1.19: Automated Company Ownership Verification**

Generated: 2025-10-25

---

## Purpose

Prevent "squatter attacks" where competitors or malicious users register companies they don't own, blocking legitimate users from onboarding.

---

## How It Works

### **Scenario 1: Legitimate Employee (Auto-Join)**

```
Alice (alice@atlassian.com) tries to onboard
  ↓
Searches ABR: "Atlassian Pty Ltd" (ABN 53102443916)
  ↓
System checks: Does ABN already exist?
  ↓
YES - Company exists (created by Bob earlier)
  ↓
Email domain check: "atlassian.com" vs "Atlassian Pty Ltd"
  ↓
MATCH! ✅ (Domain matches company name)
  ↓
AUTO-JOIN: Alice automatically added to existing company as company_admin
  ↓
SUCCESS: Alice can now use the platform immediately
```

**No human intervention needed!** ✅

---

### **Scenario 2: Squatter Blocked**

```
Bob (bob@gmail.com) tries to onboard
  ↓
Searches ABR: "Atlassian Pty Ltd" (ABN 53102443916)
  ↓
System checks: Does ABN already exist?
  ↓
YES - Company exists (created by Alice@atlassian.com)
  ↓
Email domain check: "gmail.com" vs "Atlassian Pty Ltd"
  ↓
NO MATCH ❌ (Generic email provider)
  ↓
BLOCKED: Error message shown
  ↓
Bob must request access from existing administrator (Alice)
```

**Squatter cannot hijack company!** 🛡️

## Verification Algorithm

### **Step 1: Extract & Normalize**

**User Email:** `alice@mail.atlassian.com.au`
- Domain extracted: `mail.atlassian.com.au`
- Normalized: `atlassian` (remove TLDs, subdomains)

**Company Name:** `ATLASSIAN PTY LTD`
- Normalized: `atlassian` (remove legal suffixes, special chars)

### **Step 2: Check Generic Providers**

**Instant rejection for:**
- gmail.com, yahoo.com, hotmail.com, outlook.com
- live.com, msn.com, icloud.com, me.com
- mail.com, aol.com, protonmail.com

**Reason:** Can't verify ownership via generic email

### **Step 3: Domain Matching**

**Primary Match:** Company name in domain
```
"atlassian" in "atlassian" → ✅ MATCH
```

**Reverse Match:** Domain in company name (with 70% threshold)
```
"seek" (4 chars) in "seekaustralia" (13 chars) → 31% → ❌ REJECT
"reagroup" (8 chars) in "reagroup" (8 chars) → 100% → ✅ MATCH
```

## Test Cases

### ✅ **Auto-Join Scenarios (Verified)**

| User Email | Company Name | Result | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| alice@atlassian.com | Atlassian Pty Ltd | ✅ Auto-join | Perfect match |
| user@canva.com.au | Canva Pty Ltd | ✅ Auto-join | Domain matches |
| dev@mail.seek.com | SEEK Limited | ✅ Auto-join | Subdomain ignored |
| admin@reagroup.com.au | REA Group Limited | ✅ Auto-join | Domain matches |

### ❌ **Blocked Scenarios (Must Request Access)**

| User Email | Company Name | Result | Reason |
|------------|--------------|--------|--------|
| bob@gmail.com | Atlassian Pty Ltd | ❌ Blocked | Generic provider |
| user@yahoo.com | Canva Pty Ltd | ❌ Blocked | Generic provider |
| competitor@evilcorp.com | SEEK Limited | ❌ Blocked | Different domain |
| user@atlas.com | Atlassian Pty Ltd | ❌ Blocked | Partial match (55%) |

### ✅ **New Company Creation (No Conflict)**

| User Email | Company Name | ABN Exists? | Result |
|------------|--------------|-------------|--------|
| alice@startup.com | Startup Inc | No | ✅ Create new company |
| sole@trader.com | NULL ABN | N/A | ✅ Create (no ABN) |
| user@gmail.com | My Company | No | ✅ Create new company |

- ✅ Competitor squatting on your company ABN
- ✅ Malicious users blocking legitimate owners
- ✅ Accidental duplicate company creation
- ✅ Data fragmentation across duplicate companies

### **Enables:**
- ✅ Legitimate employees auto-join without approval
- ✅ Multiple employees from same company can onboard independently  
- ✅ Zero-friction for users with company emails
- ✅ Security maintained for users with generic emails

## Future Enhancements (Epic 2)

1. **Multi-factor scoring:** Email + phone + IP + LinkedIn
2. **Document upload:** Business registration certificate
3. **Challenge system:** Real owner can claim company from squatter
4. **Admin dashboard:** Review disputed company claims

---

## Migration Required

```powershell
cd backend
alembic upgrade head
```

This adds the unique constraint on ABN (filtered to exclude NULLs).
